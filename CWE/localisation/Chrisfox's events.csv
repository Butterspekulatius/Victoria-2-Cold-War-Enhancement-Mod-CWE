EVTDESC8012026;With the success of Che's revolutionaries in toppling the Bolivian government and the already chaotic situation in Peru, the charismatic figure has decided to try his luck in yet another South American nation. While he faces many of the same challenges as he did in Bolivia, the now stronger, more well funded, and hardened fighters are sure to cause trouble in their quest to paint the Americas red.
Guevera would find common ideological ground amongst Peruvians inspired by the success of the Cuban Revolution, such as radical elements within the APRA and Communist Parties, disatissfied Quechua and Aimara peaseantry still under conditions of serfdom as was the rule in Peru before the Reforma Agraria, as well as already existing Marxist-inspired guerilla movements like the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR) and the Ejercito de Liberación Nacional (ELN). It remains to be seen if he would indeed connect at a personal level with the populace and be an effective operation leader, or if he would fail to so do as it happened during his foray at the Congo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012027;With Fujimori's reign now at an end, Peru is once again able to choose its own leaders. In the immediate aftermath of the end of the dictatorship elections have been called and already two parties have emerged to the forefront. The first one is the Progressive party 'Possible Peru' led by Alejandro Toledo, an economist born in an impoverished Quechua family. Adopted by Americans when he was an infant, he got to earn his undergraduate and postgraduate in the US, and promises to undo centuries of neglect to the poorest strata of Peru, having been poor himself. The second option is the traditional left-wing party in the nation, APRA, led by former president Alan Garcia, who returned from his self imposed exile in Paris, vowing to have learned from his previous failures during this rule. He seeks to reinstate APRA in government once again, and prove to Peru that he is worthy of being a stateman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012028;2006 marked the first serious attempt at the Ethnocacerists to achieve power through democratic means. Having joined the UPP earlier explicitly to run in the elections Ollanta faces stern opposition from the now much more reestablished traditional party on the left - the APRA. 
Constant associations with his brother Antauro, who had led an attempted uprising just a year before, overt diplomatic and financial backing from Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, and accusations of authoritarian rhetoric plagued Ollanta's campaign - almost assuring a loss in the run-offs. Meanwhile, Alan Garcia, having presented himself as a more mature politician, yet still attuned to the less fortunate classes of Peruvian society that form the backbone of the APRA militancy, leads the polls, assuring that during his rule, Peru would not only develop its economy and standard of living, but also stay away from Chavist influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012029;Peruvians return to the polls once again, this time with more contention on the ballot than ever before since the end of the dictatorship. Currently there are two candidates leading the polls. The first one is the 'Peruvian Nationalist Party' candidate Ollanta Humala, having reinvented himself into a more moderate position, far from Ethnocaceristic or Marxist ideals, yet still defending a leftist platform. The second alternative is Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of the former dictator Alberto Fujimori, running for the first time for president having served a term as congresswoman, representing a new iteration of the party built by her father during the 90s. This election pits two fears against one another; the fear of a return to the Fujimorism of the 90s, or an uncertain future with an apparently reinvented Ollanta who has previously expressed adherence to the radical 'Ethnocacerist' ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012030;In 2009 a decision by the government to allow oil companies to exploit resources in the Amazon sparked a campaign of civil disobedience and advocacy amongst the local Indigenous people that would last for more than a year.  It resulted in the government declaring martial law in the region, as well as curtailing civil liberties to attempt to quell unrest - part of a larger political crisis in Peru spurred on by a free trade agreement with the US. As the situation worsened, the military was eventually called into the Bagua province where a main bulk of the protests were occurring in what became known as the 'Baguazo'. What would follow were two days of violence between government forces and the protesters, resulting in dozens of lives lost and many more wounded. The incident would go on to destabilize the already shaky government further - leading to resignations and a repeal of the laws that led to the protests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012031;The ICC has finally released its judgement on the long-standing dispute over the maritime borders of Peru and Chile. What has been a point of contention between the two countries since after their independence was deferred to the international community for an official solution back in 2008 in - Peru's hope - securing the nation a win against its long-time rival. The decision, however, has dashed said hopes as a solution neither country had argued in favor of was brought to the table. Rather than recognizing the boundaries set by Chile or forcing a secession of the areas claimed by Peru a new boundary has been set attempting to accommodate both claims by drawing the new boundaries between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012033;Desiring a stronger and more united Peru, the ability to stand up more firmly to American imperialism, and wishing to keep to some principles of his self-ascribed ethnocacerist ideology - Humala has today announced the start of talks with Bolivia in hopes of deepening cooperation between the two nations. Mainly focusing on resistance to neo-colonialism and imperialism, the talks also touch on the possibility of reviving a confederation between the two nations. While Morales and Humala share a fairly good relationship, it is highly unlikely that such a massive shift in South America will come from these talks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012034;Peru's new president has come to us today in attempts to start talks on the revival of a union between our two states. Humala, who styles his ideology similar to that of MAS, claims that united our two nations can better protect their people from foreign imperialism and make a stronger impact on the region. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012035;Bolivia today has made history by accepting the proposal for our two states to become one once again! A long road lies ahead, but our two peoples shall walk it united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012100;In the midst of Peru's 'Internal Wars' a strange new line of thought seems to be emerging among both soldiers and civilians alike. While in its infancy, these ideals seem to put themselves in opposition to the line and doctrine that the government has taken towards the Indigenous and disputed lands - blending Indigenous thought together with left-wing economics and right-wing nationalism. While the founders of this new line of thought are not outwardly visible, yet, the enlisted men are already thinking outside the box, and gathering alongside their fellow troops after being discharged from active duty, in groupings of "reservistas" (men in Peruvian Armed Forces Reserve). It remains to be seen whether this new ideology is a threat - however it seems a new front to the war with the Shining Path could soon emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012101;Ethnocacerism, otherwise known as the 'Peruvian Nationalist Movement' is an ideology that coalesced out of and in response to the 'Internal Wars' in Peru. In particular as a reaction to the military doctrine that treated many Indigenous communities as foreign territories. It is the brainchild of Isaac Humala, a Quechua-speaking lawyer and former Marxist that was in his youth a Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) and Peruvian Communist Party militant. Claiming to be neither on the right or left, the movement embraces a third positionist stance that heavily ties itself to nationalism and a unique form of 'Indigenismo'. While the exact aims, policies, and positions of the group differ wildly, the common theme is the supremacy of the Indigenous groups in the country, as 'Heirs of the Inca', which includes a component of racial supremacy of the "raza cobriza" (the copper-coloured race, signifying the Peruvians of Amerindian descent) over other races, and the need to establish a regime that is led by and represents the interests of this community while resisting foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012102;The 'Levantamiento de Locumba' was an attempt by the brothers Ollanta and Antauro Humala to force the resignation of the Fujimori regime in the dying day's of the dictator's regime. The brothers and their "reservista" followers, donning weapons and uniforms, would go across Peru denouncing the government and spreading their message until their eventual arrest. While the uprising would be unsuccessful as such, as it was disolved without any shots fired, and it failed to gain widespread support throughout the country, those arrested would eventually be freed and Fujimori himself would resign only a mere three weeks later. This event also brought the Humala family more into the light of Peruvian society, and the 'Ethnocacerist Movement' they espoused. The word "Reservista" from this point on would become heavily linked to Ethnocacerism, to the point that the official parlance of the Armed Forces for refering to the personnel in reserve would change from "reservista" to "licenciado".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012103;In January of 2005, hoping to take advantage of the low approval of President Alejandro Toledo, stricken by several scandals that went from corruption accusations to failing to recognize his illegitimate daughter, and in protest to his perceived 'selling out' of the nation to nations like the US and Chile, Antauro Humala and several of his followers occupied a police station in Andahuaylas and began a small-scale uprising against the government.  Previously part of the 'Locumbazo Uprising', the revolutionary nationalist figure would see less success on his second attempt at ousting the government as his coup began to quickly fall apart. While having more followers than during Locumbazo, and being more heavily armed, his forces were eventually forced into surrender by the government after a detachment of Special Forces were sent to surround the city. Antauro Humala would be arrested, denied by his brother Ollanta as he would run for president in the following year, and Ethnocacerism would be regarded as a violent organization... But it would not be the end of Ethnocacerism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012104;Antauro Humala, one of the leaders of the Ethnocacerist Movement within Peru, has recently published a series of books outlining his views and aims for the movement.
Delving from geopolitical arguments supporting his vision, and making forays into reinterpreting and bringing back the extinct Incan cults into the mainstream, as a way to stand against the ideals brought over by the "invaders", Humala's writings didn't cease to be distributed even after his incarceration after the Andahuaylazo. Written in plain Spanish, so that more people from the lower classes could read and understand them, these texts help to clarify its points and frames the ideology in context of other Indigenous movements across the Americas; setting it to other streams of thought as well as outlining and refining its goals and aims. Perhaps the most known of these works would be "From Ethnosacred war to the Tahuantinsuyan Church", which would be featured in the International Book Fair of Lima, gaining international notoriety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012105;Peru is now in a state of chaos. The government has fallen, parties are scrambling to organize for elections, and at the forefront of the nation stand the now triumphant Humala brothers with their "reservistas" who were responsible toppling the deeply unpopular, yet democratic, regime. While initially only an attempt at bringing down the president and his ministers, some Peruvian Army officers that were former classmates of the Humala brothers, and now are in positions of power as generals and colonels, have began to suggest that the time has come for a new path for Peru - one guided by its Indigenous people in the footsteps of their ancestors. If the Humala family is willing to conduct the process, and develop even further the Ethnocacerist Movement, while allowing them to continue their military career, they are willing to put their men and equipment to the service of the Movement. While this would indeed signal the end of democracy in Peru, it would be the beginning of the vindication of the "raza cobriza" in Peru and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012106;With a new regime now in place the question of leadership has arisen. The obvious choices would be either Ollanta or Antauro - both of which participated in the original uprisings to oust Fujimori and Toledo and are fiery characters with experience in the military and politics. 
However there are two other choices to consider that have some support within the new Nationalist Party, one being the original ideological founder of the movement, the former communist Isaac Humala, the "Patriarch" of the family, which still holds Marxist ideals close to heart. The other being the relatively unknown Ulises Humala, an economics engineer and university professor who studied his postgraduate in France, who styles himself a more moderate nationalist and a 'pragmatist', although not shy to use force if prompted, similar to his brothers and father. Whatever the choice, given the nebulous nature of the Ethnocacerist Movement, it is likely that the initial leader of the state will dictate the standard for the ideology going forward, even if the rest of the family will not necessarily agree with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012107;Despite having guided our revolution since its birth with a fiery zeal, Isaac's age has finally started to catch up to him. Recently our leader has announced his retirement from politics, having already tapped one of his three children as potential successors - with each already campaigning within the upper ranks of the party for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8012108;With Ollanta taking over as President the time has come to decide on the fate of possible reforms. Ollanta himself wishes to see a modernization of the regime, with an opening of the command-style economy and a more pragmatic approach to foreign and domestic affairs. However, many within the party are unlikely to be pleased with radical change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012109;With Ulises now occupying the post of President the time has come to decide the fate of possible reforms. Considering himself a 'moderate' and 'pragmatist', Ulises wishes to do away with the more overt authoritarianism of the 'Incan' state and open the country up both within and without. While such sweeping reforms are likely to upset the hardliners within the party, Ulises hinges on support from the population for much of his planned agenda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012110;With his reforms resulting in backlash not only from within the party, but from the populace as well, Ollanta is faced with almost no other choice but to resign. Already Antauro has come out against the 'neoliberal reforms', promising a return to the policies of his father - pitting himself in opposition not only to Ollanta but to Ulises as well, who promises a more 'honest reform' of the nation and a turn towards more pragmatic and democratically-based policies. Though there are a small number within the party and military that continue to support Ollanta silently, though a move to stay in power with their support would likely cause even more unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012111;The DPRK has an interesting ideology - it incorporates elements of strong nationalism with a socialist system. While far from Marxism-Leninism, the 'Third Positionism' of our Ethnocacerist Movement could blend in elements of this system with our own for a stronger and more stable ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8023012100;With Stalin's death and new policies within the USSR a wave of so-called 'De-Stalinization' has swept across the Eastern Bloc nations. While Romania has been steadfastly pro-Stalinist since the proclamation of the proletarian dictatorship, the question now faces the leadership on how viable it is to keep to policies that have seemed to quickly fall out of favor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012101;While many both within and beyond the borders of the Soviet Union oppose the new policies of De-Stalinization, none could be considered as strong of a holdout within the Soviet sphere as Romania. While the loyalty and hardline adherence to Stalinism served the late Soviet leader well, it poses a problem for the new  more moderate  leadership.\n\nGiven that Gheorghiu-Dej seems to have no intention of following the course outlined by the Soviet example, and the examples being followed in several Eastern Bloc states, some have  though in no serious capacity  suggested that the USSR take a more active approach in ensuring the new line is followed. However, others have argued that given Romanias stability any massive shift in their politics, especially one instigated by Moscow, could have dire consequences down the line. In either case, the official position has yet to be set.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012102;With our refusal to betray Stalins legacy the USSRs new revisionist leadership has given us an ultimatum; bow before the new line being towed or have it forced upon us. While many within the party are confident of Romanias ability to rally popular support against any coup attempt by the Soviets, others have expressed concern that a refusal to follow Moscows line could result in another lengthy occupation of the country and an unfavorable renegotiation of post-war treaties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012103;The Soviet Union, victorious, has dictated terms for the establishment of a new transitional government to oversee the reestablishment of its authority. Many members of the Prison Faction that stood resolute in defense of Stalinism and in defiance of so-called revisionism have already been arrested or ousted from government and members of the Moscow Faction have already been tapped for replacing the now vacant positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012104;With Gheorghiu-Dejs grip on Romania having weakened with the death of Stalin and pressure from a now anti-Stalinist Moscow, forces within the political apparatuses of the nation and party have moved quickly to replace the old defender of the Stalinist order. Pauker, already having been in a position of power and prominence, has rallied her support within the Moscow Faction and courted enough moderate support to ensure Gheorghiu-Dejs ouster without issue  as well as to secure her own place within Romanian politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012105;Gheorghiu-Dejs death means the passing of the torch of Romanian politics to another within the party.  Apostols remaining support within the party and prominence within Romania mean a more competitive succession. Already both of the prospective candidates are attempting to rally enough support to be nominated as the next First Secretary. While Ceaucescu seems to have a slight advantage due to infighting, Apostol remains a solid choice for many who hope to continue the competent stability of the previous decade with a more tested hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012106;Even before her rise to now, Ana Pauker had helped facilitate the emigration of several thousand Romanian Jews to the new state of Israel  defying the Stalinist norm at the time that saw increasing restrictions on both emigration and immigration. While many Jews remained in Romania, her efforts had earned her ire from political rivals and praise from her political allies and the Jewish community itself.\n\nHowever, now that she is no longer challenged by those same Stalinist forces the opportunity has arisen to provide a Right of Return to all of Romanias remaining Jews to their new homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012107;With power in Romania now passing to anti-Stalinists, the time has come to purge the late Soviet leaders influence from within the party and Romanian society. Ana Pauker  initially seen as supportive of the direction of the new government before turning out of its favor with increasingly vocal opposition  has today announced a campaign of liberalization within the party, with even more far-reaching plans for strengthening the Moscow Faction influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012108;The Magyar Wing of Romanias Communist Party was dissolved in 1953, just a year after the creation of the Magyar Autonomous Region in Romania. It had provided one of the few mechanisms for Hungarians in Romania to fight against the increasing policy of Romanianization from the Nationalists and Stalinists that had helped prop up the rule of Gheorghiu-Dej. \n\nGiven that the Stalinists no longer wield much political influence  the question has been brought up by more liberal-minded party members as to a potential revival of this institution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012109;Ana Pauker, during the rule of previous First Secretary Gheorghiu-Dej, had been a vocal opponent of the forced collectivization and the hardline and strict persecution of the bourgeoisie. She had been able to exert the influence she held to moderate such policies, however with her now occupying the position of her former rival the opportunity has arisen to completely reassess those policies in their entirety. Already she has outlined plans to move towards more voluntary collectivization, enact limited market reforms, incorporate more organizations into the People's Democratic Front, and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012110;Ana Pauker, First Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, has passed away today due to complications from cancer. Already, however, her supporters have moved to secure her legacy within Romania. Teohari Georgescu has risen as the favourite from the Moscow Faction camp, facing opposition from Apostol who has taken on a more vocally Stalinist and hardline tone  decrying Romanias current state as 'revisionist'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012111;Citing a rapidly deteriorating health, First Secretary Teohari Georgescu has today announced his retirement from his post  and politics. While he has thus served as a competent moderate from the Moscow Faction of the party  his succession is not so clear cut. The two most notable candidates are the even more reform-oriented Ion Illescu and the Stalinist-Reformist Apostol. Both enjoy support within the party and in Moscow itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012112;Ceaucescus disastrous decisions to embark on increased trade with the west, as well as his liberal usage of money loaned to Romania for development on projects that never saw completion, have drained the countries coffers and cost the regime a great deal of support both within and outside of the party. With new leadership, it is finally time to rectify the situation and begin the process of repaying Romanias debts, reinvesting in the unfinished projects, fostering trade ties with more friendly regimes, and increasing spending on social programs for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012113;De-Stalinization in Romania brought about a period of openness and liberalization that saw the implementation of various reforms both political and economic. Under such a system Apostol himself was able to rise, in part thanks to the gradual removal of more hardline opponents from positions of power. However, the first Secretary position is now held by a Stalinist once more  if only a moderate one. The question has turned to the fate of the ideology has a whole within Romania; with many pointing out the stability the system brought while others contrast with the strict repressions and conservatism that run counter to more open variants of socialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012114;Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej, while having its own set of troubles, saw an increase in living standards and an overall recovery and growth in the post-war Romania economy. However, those times have long since past and once again the need arises to help steer Romania towards the path of prosperity. With Apostol and his allies holding the reigns of power, any reform and shift in economic policy is expected to be more in line with the previous course  only making changes and adapting where need be to fit the current material conditions of the country and wider world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012115;Ceaucescus attempt at opposing the might of the Soviet Union has come to an end in contrast to the former First Secretarys wishes. With Moscows authority now restored, now instead has been vested into the hands of the loyal Stalinist Apostol in hopes that his leadership of Romania will steer the nation to be more in line with the Eastern Bloc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012116;After nearly a decade of economic downturn, constant delays in various uncompleted projects, and increasing orientation towards Western trading partners  Romania finally sees the fruit of its hardships. With many projects now nearing their completion and beginning to increase production and pay their dues, Ceaucescu has made the decision to gradually cancel austerity measures  investing the new revenue back into Romania. Hopefully this will be the start of a period of economic growth and recovery, and win back the initial popularity the statesman held when he first assumed his office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012117;During the tumultuous events that swept across the Eastern Bloc, Hungary was seemingly one of the multiple regimes to fall. While this leaves us even more vulnerable to encroachment and imperialism from the West, we are not left without recourse.\n\nMany within the party are suggesting that we set aside funding to provide to the communist forces in Hungary to quickly reorganize themselves and participate in the next elections. While its unlikely they will be able to do much within the confines of a bourgeoise state, maintaining some degree of relations with our former Bloc members will go a long way to securing the continuation of our Socialist Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012118;Ceaucescus disastrous decisions to embark on increased trade with the west, as well as his liberal usage of money loaned to Romania for development on projects that never saw completion, have drained the countries coffers and cost the regime a great deal of support both within and outside of the party.

EVTDESC8023012119;Romania under Gheorghiu-Dej, while having its own set of troubles, saw an increase in living standards and an overall recovery and growth in the post-war Romania economy. However, those times have long since past and once again the need arises to help steer Romania towards the path of prosperity. With Ion Illescu holding the position of First Secretary its almost certain that the response to the changing material conditions in Romania and the wider world will be more sweeping and wide-spread than under the previous leaders of the party  with programs already laid out to implement market reforms within the nation modeled after the Reformists in the CPSU and the CPC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023012120;Facing mounting unrest and wide-spread protests as the communist Eastern Bloc faces a crisis of unprecedented scale  the government of Ion Illescu today has announced its intention to meet with prominent figures within the anti-government movement in hopes of working towards a peaceful solution to the unrest within the nation. While Illescu is seen as a reformist candidate and many expect him to make numerous concessions, confidence remains high that communism will be preserved within Romania and that any reforms will take place within the existing framework.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023008;The years 1945 and 1946 in Romania were marked not only by the end of a calamitous war, but by one of the worst droughts in Romanian history. While the nation itself was no stranger to these phenomena, this one is proving to be more than a disaster. The damage to crops and agriculture yields would go on to result in famine across the post-war landscape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023009;Even prior to the Second World War, Romania's economy had struggled. With the war itself, Romania was left in ruins. The Romanian leu, having been heavily tied to the German Reichsmark thanks to the influence exerted on the nation by the nazi regime, now suffered from severe inflation and poor exchange rates. Additionally, droughts and fighting had taken their toll on both industry and agriculture, leaving little in the post-war state. With the conclusion of the war, and the new state in which Romania finds itself, it is almost certain much effort is required to pull the country from the brink of turmoil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023010;SovRoms refers to Soviet-Romanian enterprises created throughout Romania in the years following the creation of the Socialist Republic of Romania. In theory their design was to facilitate economic rebuilding and restructuring within the new state. In practice, however, they would pivot Romania's exports towards the USSR and serve as an addition means of enforcing post-war reparations - a process that would continue until the death of Stalin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023011;After nearly two years of one of the worst droughts in Romania's history the country's luck has seemingly finally taken a turn for the better. Ample rainfall has lead to a boost in agricultural production, as well as a reduction of the severity of the famines that had struck during those two prior years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230121;Romania's currency - the 'Romanian leu' - is still struggling from the effects of the second world war. Economic devastation, increasing inflation, and absurd exchange rates stifle any sense of recovery. In this environment it has been decided to enact a series of reforms aimed at providing a remedy for this and facilitating Romania's post-war recovery.\n\n Under these plans - referred to as the 'Great Stabilization' - the 'First leu' would be succeeded by by the 'Second leu', with the old currency being replaced via a set exchange rate. These changes, while drastic, are seen as the only way out of the dire situation the country finds itself in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230122;Two major factions have been battling for power within the Romanian Communist Party since the nation's liberation from nazi Germany at the hands of the Soviet Union; the 'Prison Faction', informally lead by the country's current leader Gheorghiu-Dej, and the 'Moscow Faction' (sometimes called the 'Pauker Faction') lead by Ana Pauker.\n\nWhile currently Gheorghiu-Dej's pro-Stalinist and hardline 'Prison Faction' holds a dominant position, it has become increasingly threatened by the more moderate and reformist policies and positions of those in its rival group. Ana Pauker - while serving as one of the main figures in the communization of the country - has since taken a hard stance against Stalinism, halting forced collectivization, granting amnesty to former members and supporters of the former fascist regime, preserving aspects bourgeoise, and pushing to broaden the 'People's Democratic Front' coalition set up by the Communist Party. \n\nThese actions, combined with her Jewish ancestry, have earned her a less favorable outlook from Stalin in recent years. Combined with Gheorghiu-Dej's fears of a potential threat to his rule, a decision has been reached on the possibility of purging Pauker and her more vocal supporters with Soviet backing - preventing any future conflict or opposition to leadership within the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230123;Even after the previous currency reform in 1947, additional steps were taken to once again revalue the Romanian leu as well as to enact additional reforms. The reforms would also include provisions for the rate of exchange, the materials the coins were made out of, and different denominations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230124;Following Romanias proclamation of a Proletarian state, the country reorganized its administrative boundaries along-side the implementation of the new socialist system. While previously it had been divided into judetes, pressure from the USSR would see it instead organize into regions and raions that would serve as the base division for the new country.\n\nOne such region was set to be the Magyar Autonomous Region, modeled at least in aesthetic after the ASSRs found in the Soviet Union. The territory encompassed most of the historic region of Szekelyland at the heart of Romania, covering territories where Hungarian was the dominant ethnic group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230125;The 'New Course', or 'Neuer Kurs' in German, referred to a series of economic and political reforms that were dictated by the USSR in the wake of Stalin's death across the Eastern Bloc countries. In Romania this would take the form of increased independence for the nation and for the ruling communist party. The SovRoms, set up as joint Soviet-Romanian enterprises in the aftermath of WWII to help reconstruct Romania's devastated economy, were fully handed over to Romania - with many being outright replaced with fully Romanian successors. \n\nOverall the 'New Course' was to, in the opinion of the USSR and the supporters of the program, 'correct the errors of the past' as well as to lead to a more prosperous post-war situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230126;With Stalin's death and new policies within the USSR a wave of so-called 'De-Stalinization' has swept across the Eastern Bloc nations. While Romania has been steadfastly pro-Stalinist since the proclamation of the proletarian dictatorship, the question now faces the leadership on how viable it is to keep to policies that have seemed to quickly fall out of favor. \n\nWith the purge of the 'Moscow Faction' earlier, 'De-Stalinization' would almost certainly mean a rehabilitation of these politicians and their return to power within the communist party. Given Khrushchev's view on Stalin's legacy, many hardliners fear of Soviet influence being used to put the newly rehabilitated moderates into power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230127;The uprising in Hungary sent shockwaves through the Eastern Bloc, with the Soviet response drawing both fears and praise. In Romania, however, another fear emerged from the leadership of the nation. Already holding a nationalist lean to it, the uprising would spark concerns about the large Hungarian population within Romania. The Stalinist Prison Faction and Gheorghiu-Dej would use these concerns as an excuse for furthering the aims of Romanianization, limiting the autonomy of Hungarians within Romania and taking an active role in helping to deal with the aftermath of the attempted revolution in its close neighbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230128;Seeking to curb Soviet influence in Romania, and the countrys increasing dependence on the USSR for exports and trade, Gheorghiu-Dej has made the suggestion that Romania  at least in a very limited degree  seek out Western partners for trade and commerce. While on the face such a plan seems absurd for a member of the Eastern Bloc, Romanias unique position presents it and opportunity few of its allies have.\n\nHowever, some within the party have even still expressed their discontent. Relying on the West  avowedly anti-communist  for trade could end up hurting Romania in the long-run. Instead, some have made the suggestion that we merely increase trade ties with our fellow Eastern Bloc members and those of CMEA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230129;The I.P.R.S. (Intreprinderea de piese radio si semiconductori), or by its English name Baneasa Radio and Semiconductor Parts Company was the name of an electronics manufacturer built in Romania during 1960 that would go on to produce electronic components  particularly semi-conductors  throughout the 70s and 80s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230130;For years now a rivalry has brewed within the inner circle of Gheorghiu-Dej between his protégé Nicolae Ceaucescu and the Stalinist Reformist Gheorghe Apostol. While the former has the immediate backing of the party, the latter still carries substantial influence and holds a position of authority within the party  having even briefly served as First Secretary and President of the Assembly.\n\nSeeking to tip the balance of the eventual struggle for support between the two within the partys leadership, Ceaucescu ally Ion Gheorghe Maurer has started a campaign to rally support for the young protégé  hoping to win enough to prevent Apostol from posing any significant challenge in the event of Cheorghiu-Dejs death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230131;Hoping to increase birthrates within Romania, preserve the traditional family structures within, and help increase its competitiveness with other nations  Ceaucescu today has pushed forward a new law to the National Assembly referred to as Decree 770. The law, if left unchallenged, would have far-reaching effects on both healthcare and education.\n\nAiming for a population increase of nearly 10 million, the law would effectively outlaw abortion in one of the most liberal countries in Europe in regards to reproductive rights. Not only that, but sex education and other such forms of outreach would heavily shift their focus to the virtues of motherhood and large families to help further the boom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230132;Even before the death of Gheorghiu-Dej, Soviet influence in Romania was on the decline  with the country taking an increasing independent direction both politically and economically in the face of being one of the last bastions of Stalinism in the Eastern Bloc. However, many vestiges still remain tightly gripped around Romania society. One such being the administrative system of Romania  in which the previous system was abandoned in favor of one influenced by the Soviet model. \n\nAs part of a new policy following Gheorghiu-Dejs death, dubbed De-Russification, such systems are slowly being abandoned. Many within the party that wish to see a continued decline of Soviet influence are instead proposing the reorganization of Romania under a new system, one that would importantly see the dissolution of the Magyar Autonomous Region and a strengthening of Romanias central government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230133;Ceaucescu inherited a unique position within the Eastern Bloc  one established by his mentor and predecessor Gheorghiu-Dej. Romania, in contrast to much of the rest of the communist world at the time, enjoyed at least mildly warm relations with several western nations and even international and national organizations seen as being agents or controlled by the west. The main question facing the new administration however is whether to keep this course or start anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230134;The Research Center for the Design of Electronic Components, later renamed to the Research Institute for Electronic Components, is the name of a electronics research center built near the previously manufactured electronics factory. It would go on to conduct experiments in the field of computing within Romania  facilitating the production of gradually more advanced components.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230135;Microelectronica was created in 1981 and began production of integrated circuits the same year. Together with the I.P.R.S. it would go on to complete and complement the chain of production having already been established with the previous facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230136;The July Theses referred to a speech given by Ceaucescu in which he outlined a plan to launch a Small Cultural Revolution in Romania in hopes of achieving a more socialist culture as well as to some degree to emulate that which had happened in the PRC. The plan blended elements of Neo-Stalinism together with Maoism to hope to achieve some new synthesis as well as to provide a avenue for Ceaucescu to personally increase his power over the party and his popularity with the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230137;Systematization, in Romania, referred to a particular program of urban planning advocated for by the Ceaucescu administration following the leaders visit to the communist countries of East Asia. In particular he would find the particular inspiration the DPRK with the ideology of Juche and the architecture and economic direction that the country had taken since its independence. As part of the program older buildings  particularly those in smaller villages, towns, and hamlets  would be rebuilt in hopes of turning them into larger urban centers. Additionally, a massive campaign of urbanization would be undertaken to help populate these new cities  hoping to eliminate small rural population centers entirely in the stead of more developed and centralized ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230138;During the first years of his time in office, Ceaucescu enjoyed popularity brought upon by a good economy, a slight relaxing of policies, and an orientation towards a more independent course for Romania. However, since that time the tides have shifted against his favor. Various projects remain uncompleted, debt to Western powers has increased to levels that put Romania itself at risk, and several policies have bore unintended consequences that only exacerbate the rapidly deteriorating issues. In response, the IMF has laid out guidelines for Romania to follow should it seek to pay its debt; namely putting spending, reducing imports, and increasing exports. While some scoff at the idea of bowing to the IMF  the countrys previous relationship with the West means that defying such an institution could have dire consequences for Romania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230139;With the continued lowering popularity and slow decline of the Ceau?escu regime, dissenting members of the Communist Party (Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru Bârl?deanu, Grigore R?ceanu, Corneliu M?nescu, and Constantin Pîrvulescu) created an open letter to the regime that came to be referred to as The Letter of the Six. \n\nThe letter provided a left-wing critique of the regime, as well as demands for reform by the government. While notable among the signatories was a staunch Stalinist  the letter made a point to allude to the policies and positions advocated by the reformists with the CPSU and appealed to a more humanist approach to socialism. It also warned of a possible future of an underdeveloped Romania under the continued mismanagement of Ceausescu and his allies.\n\nDue to Ceausescus repression against opponents both within and without the party and the countries history of hardline Stalinism  the letter was broadcast via Western outlets such as RFE-RL, BBC, and Voice of America. The immediate aftermath saw the signatories  most of which were already in or had recently returned to Romania  arrested or otherwise removed from their positions of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230140;Amid the chaotic aftermath of the Romanian Revolution a series of violent and bloody clashes took place in Hungarian-dominated areas of the country. The extent of the altercations would leave 5 dead and 300 injured and serve to strengthen animosity between the two groups. While the events were widely publicized  even receiving media coverage at the time  the cause would be a point of contention and dispute in the years after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230141;Following the FSN stating its intention to reform into a political party and run in Romanias first elections as a western democracy, unrest broke out both from within the organization and without. Forces within the FSN that had opposed the previous communist regime and hoped to see a clean slate for Romanian politics left while protests broke out at the University of Bucharest. These protests, dominated primarily by professors and students, demanded that former communist officials be barred from running for elections and that the current government cede further towards the cause of reform. The government would go on to brand these protests as hooligans (Golani in Romanian), spawning their self-given satirical name Golaniad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230142;The Mineriads refer to a series of wide-spread and violent protests that occurred throughout the post-communist period in Romania in 1990 and 1991. They were mostly directed at the ruling FSN, made up of both opposition parties and anti-communist elements that saw the FSN as merely a successor of the previous government rather than a complete transformation from it. The most violent of these altercations, happening in 1990, would be put down with the help of miners and workers  members of unions  called in by the government to help keep order. Over the course of each of the clashes multiple people would be killed or injured  and the continued unrest would serve to weaken the FSNs authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230143;Following the collapse of the Ceaucescu government, free elections were scheduled within Romania. While marred by violence, accusations of fraud and rigging, and continued chaos across the country  they would go on to be hailed as the nations first free elections as a non-communist regime. Due to the haste with which they were scheduled, only two political entities were able to participate; the FSN, the dominant political force behind the Romanian Revolution, and the National Liberal Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230144;While the Romanian Revolution had established a de-jure western-styled republic, it would not be until the countrys new constitution in 1991 that the Socialist Republic of Romania would be officially replaced with a new entity. Facing continued pressure from the protesters, as well as finding no support from its once foreign allies, the FSN  while having within its ranks many former members of Romanias communist party  did away with the remainder of the old regime and declared a new Republic in its place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230145;In the aftermath of the chaotic and messy decommunization of Romania and the introduction of a market economy, a pyramid scheme started by Ioan Stocia managed to gain prominence. Making vague promises of massive profits to those that invested, the scheme would sweep through the nation  attracting large swaths of the population, suffering under newly imposed spending cuts, austerity, and inflation, who would go on to put most of their savings within the schemes investments. By the time the scheme was exposed  with the company of Caritas having gone bankrupt in 1994  nearly 35-50% of the nation had fallen prey to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230146;1992 marked the first of Romanias true elections since the countries constitution in 1991 officially abolished the previous communist regime. Unlike the impromptu elections in 1990, it would not be marked by violence and chaos  instead seeing newly organized parties rise to prominence as they challenged the DFSN  a splinter of the FSN  for its place in the Romanian government. Ion Illescu, still leading the DFSN, faced off against the National Peasants Party which promised a quicker transition of the country away from its past and more extreme decommunization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230147;The 1996 elections in Romania once again pit Ion Illescu and his social democratic PDSR (the DFSN having since reorganized) against the National Peasants Party, with the same dynamics at play as previous elections. Once more, the NPP would promise a faster transition to a fully market economy, as well as more strict adherence to the new governing principles while the DFSN would run on its now social democratic platform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230148;Ostalgia, or 'Ostalgie'  made up from the German words Ost and Nostalgie  describes a phenomena in the post-communist states that encompasses a wide rage of favorable outlooks on the previous communist regimes in those nations. While taking different forms in different places, having different motivations, and being both manipulated by and viewed in different lights by various political groups and portions of the population  its effect on the mindset and culture of the nations and peoples that experience it is hard to ignore. Across much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc the so-called Ostalgia would go on to inspire voting patterns, art, culture, and even the rise of new organizations and ideologies.\n\nIn Romania, Ostalgic views persisted far beyond the fall of the communist regime  with much of the population viewing even the Ceau?escu years, still in living memory for many, in a more positive light and many more even seeing the country as having fared better under its previous administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230149;The 2000 election in Romania would see the rise of a new prominent party to challenge the authority of the PDSR. Calling itself the Great Romania Party, the party would mix a blend of position and points and build them around a central theme of nationalism and conservatism. Seen by many as a Third Positionist party, it rely heavily on populist rhetoric and irredentist desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230150;Romanias election in 2004 would pit both successors of the National Salvation Front against one another; the Democratic Party against once more reorganized Social Democratic Party. While both parties would run to the left at times, the Democratic Party would increasingly take on a more liberal and less social democratic policy stance over time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230151;Having faced flooding along the Danube in the year before - both Bulgaria and Romania would be stricken by a severe drought the following year in 2007. Spurred on by poor snowfall during the winter and very little rain in the Spring the event would go on to be one of most severe in Eastern Europe since after WWII - leading to millions of hectares in crops being destroyed and both nations being left with low yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230152;Romanias 2009 election would once more see the Democratic Party, now more established, face off against the Social Democrats. The election would be marked by limited controversy  claims of fraud and multiple reports of void and invalid ballots spurring on electoral challenges and interventions by neutral organizations such as the OSCE.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230153;The 2014 elections in Romania saw a continuation of the scandal and controversy of the previous, adding to that even more as allegations continued to be hurled about between parties. Rising to the front to criticize the Democratic Party along-side the PSD was the National Liberal Party, itself making promises of ending the era of the previous administration and bring about a transformed Romania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80230154;2019 in Romania would pit the National Liberal Party against the Social Democratic Party. While media controversy surrounded nearly all of the candidates, the fresh elections would mark a break from the previous two in terms of scandal and accusations of fraud and corruption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
