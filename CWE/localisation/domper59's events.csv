EVT_9001023_DESC;The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) took place in Moscow, RSFSR between 29 March and 8 April 1966. It was the first Congress during Leonid Brezhnev's leadership of the Party and state. This Congress will provide places for personalities in key positions, such as Brezhnev, Kosygin and others. But it is important on because it will determine the new five-year plan of the USSR. Kosygin and his supporters, with a large majority, proposes to study the proposals of Libermann, an economist. However, there is an alternative proposed by Cybernetics, that of automating the Soviet economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001024_DESC;Not surprisingly, Liberman's reforms were chosen. This would give greater management autonomy to companies (freedom to set a price and a salary, to hire, to order...). It will be first experimented in the Shchyokinsky chemical plant at the beginning. However, this reform meets resistance from conservatives, such as Leonid Brezhnev, because it requires the party to loosen its grip on the Soviet economy and fears that this will lead to the emergence of a kind of technocracy capable of challenging their decisions, powers and privileges. Should you fully adopt Liberman's Reforms or make a compromise and adopt it partially?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001025_DESC;It was with surprise that Victor Glushkov's ideas resurfaced. Cybernetics is far from unknown and the project of automating the Soviet economy already dates back to Stalin's time. But the party seems to have realized the full potential of this project that could move the Soviet Union in the field of science and computer science ahead of the West and may well save the country in the future. The CPSU has already released money to generalize computers. It remains to be seen whether we want partial or complete automation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001027_DESC;In order to greatly improve the access and organization of our economy, it was decided a few years ago to introduce computers massively. This first step was reached and it became common for the Soviets to work with computers, no matter how big they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001033_DESC;We have just passed a new milestone, an automated calculation system has been created in order to reduce falsifications and better organize working time. This is the core of the OGAS project...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001034_DESC;We have managed to install a computer network to link our computers to better communicate information across the country and allow acceleration in the field of research. This is already a great leap forward for the West. Our economy is now much easier to manage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001070_DESC;In March 1956, rallies took place in Georgia, especially in its capital, Tbilisi. Demonstrations took place to denounce Khrushchev's speech, many of the demonstrators were Stalinists, but also nationalists, who saw Stalin as an icon of their national identity. Now, strong demands are said, such as the independence of Georgia or a radical change of the central government in Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001071_DESC;Stalin's legacy has always been a problem in the Soviet Union, especially for the ruling class, and has had many reactions and consequences in the socialist camp. Today, the question is still raised, some radicals would like to establish a real cult for Stalin, to see him above all as the one who turned the country from a backward nation into a world power or a figure of anti-fascism. Others, more moderate and conservative, would like to create a commission to judge Stalin's role for the country (Stalin made mistakes, but above all he had an important role for the country). And finally, more "reformist" people would like to denounce Stalin in all aspects and concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In order to bring us closer to China, the Secretary General can appointed a new Foreign Minister: Oleg Troyanovsky. He is a very experienced diplomat who served as ambassador to Japan. If appointed, he shall have the heavy task of trying to bring the Soviet Union and China closer together. This decision initiates a chain of events that can end the Sino-Soviet Split.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001074_DESC;Our delegation has just arrived in China to try to settle our differences. It may not be easy but not impossible. The first subject of division is political: the Soviet Union and China considered themselves, since the de-Stalinization, as the true Marxist-Leninists and accused each other of Revisionism. Do we stay on this position, do we try to compromise or do we admit our mistakes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001075_DESC;Now that the political issue has been settled, we must now be clear about our attitude towards Western Imperialism, especially the USA. Indeed, especially since the Cuban crisis, China accuses us of being too soft on the Americans. Should we maintain Khrushchev's position, engage in a discussion by putting forward a pragmatic diplomatic policy, or should we assert our hatred against Western Imperialism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001076_DESC;And finally, the last subject of discord between the USSR and China is a border problem. The region has always been a source of conflict but has become so since the Sino-Soviet breakup. Should we maintain the official line, try to calm things down with the negotiation of a treaty, or should we cede territories to China?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001077_DESC;Despite attempts at reconciliation, the meeting ended with an incomprehensible volley of personal and political insults. Our divisions have deepened and it's going to take some time before it calms down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001079_DESC;It's done! We have managed to find a compromise for everyone so that we can re-sign a Friendship Pact between our two countries. Although there are still differences between us, our two great countries are together again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001081_DESC;It's a general surprise! The American president visited Mao, in China. What little hope we had of re-establishing relations with China has been extinguished !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001082_DESC;Our leader has just made contact with the Soviet Union. The purpose of this visit is to bring us closer together, and perhaps one day to re-establish relations as before the Sino-Soviet split.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001087_DESC;After several months of negotiations and disagreements between our two countries, it seems that we have reached a balanced agreement. Now is the time to find out if we can become friends and even brothers again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001088_DESC;Thanks to the efforts of Oleg Troyanovsky, China has agreed to reconcile with us. The two leaders met in Beijing to sign a friendship pact! This is very good news for the socialist camp, not so good news for the West. The socialist camp has been strengthened by a strong ally, and the two big brothers can finally stand next to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001089_DESC;Despite Oleg Troyanovsky's efforts, China refused to reconcile with us. One thing is clear from now on, we can never be friends again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001035_DESC;On May 18, 1967, Yuri Andropov became head of the KGB. He established the principle of socialist legality, which definitively broke with Stalinist methods of arbitrariness. Very marked by his experience during the Prague Spring, he embarked on the path of reformism and began to attempt reforms to try to save the Soviet Union. He is considered, in hindsight, as the father of Perestroika and Glasnost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001036_DESC;Fyodor Kulakov, Secretary of Agriculture of the Central Committee and potential successor of Leonid Brezhnev, is a very important reformer (he is the mentor of a certain Gorbachev). The Soviet Union has always had agricultural difficulties and Kulakov is studying in a very active but secret way the experiences that are being made in Hungary and Yugoslavia. He seems to want to introduce a decentralized management of collective farms and state farms, create agricultural cooperatives based on the family contract and the farm individual. We can use this as a pretext to eliminate it politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001037_DESC;Peter Masherov, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus and a veteran of the Partisans, has, since his appointment in 1965, achieved important developments in this Republic by increasing the national income of Belarus and enabled industrial and agricultural development. However, Masherov attracted the thunderbolts of many party members as he renewed the Communist Party of Belarus and had conflictual relations with the party ideologue Mikhail Suslov and was also very close to the disgraced Kulakov. However, Leonid Brezhnev is counting on him to replace the former head of the Council of Ministers, Alexei Kossygin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001038_DESC;Dinmukhammed Kunaev, was the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and had the particularity, unlike other secretaries, of being of Kazakh nationality. He was a very close friend of Brezhnev and succeeded in developing Kazakhstan by developing the mining, raw materials and energy industries. However, a commission for the creation of an autonomous region for the German population, composed among others of Yuri Andropov, is very badly regarded by Kunaev and he is tempted to provoke riots with the Kazakh population in case this autonomy is created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001039_DESC;Shortly after the departure of Leonid Brezhnev, the Eighth General Directorate of the USSR on the orders of the 1st Vice-President of the General Committee, Semyon Tsvigun, disconnected the communication from the government, thus completely isolating the Secretary General from any information. With the help of the opposition in the KGB, Mikhail Suslov and Vladimir Scherbitsky quickly convened an emergency plenary session of the Central Committee, in which Yuri Andropov was accused of "using the power of the KBG to prepare a Coup, of being a spy at the service of the West" and so on. Yuri Andropov tried to retaliate, but after Vladimir Scherbitsky's speech, accusing him of planning to assassinate Brezhnev, he realized that he had lost. The Committee adopts the decision to remove Andropov from all posts, banish him from the Party and arrest him. The new President of the KGB begins a massive purge of Andropov's staff and to replace them with more suitable employees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001040_DESC;For the last two years, Brezhnev has been nothing but a figurehead. His health deteriorated during the winter of 1981. During this time, the country was ruled by Vladimir Scherbitsky and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine took decisions himself, so much so that Kiev had become the new capital of the USSR. The question of Leonid Brezhnev's succession was no longer a problem now that the reformist threat had been eliminated at the root. Rumors say that the Secretary General has already told me in confidence that he can now die in peace. His death heralds the end of one era and the beginning of another for the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001041_DESC;In the struggle to improve the economic situation of the state, Andropov began with a large-scale campaign to strengthen labor discipline. At the same time, high-profile corruption cases were triggered and a fight against unearned income and speculation was declared. The fight against commercial abuses became widespread. During the years of Andropov's reign, the number of persons convicted of criminal offenses increased significantly. Andropov began a "purge" of the party and the state apparatus, including the security organs. At the beginning of 1983, Andropov instructed Gorbachev and Ryzhkov to start preparing an economic reform, the word of Perestroika began to be used and was later taken over by Gorbachev. One does not know, however, the exact content of this reform even though she knows that it was much less radical than what was done afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001043_DESC;The greatest scourge of the Soviet Union is certainly its corruption. In order to curb it, Shcherbitsky carried out anti-corruption investigations, but not against the people, but against important members of the Politburo and other political bodies of great importance. Rarely, some of these trials even received media coverage. A major purge seems to have begun, but the targets are party cadres this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001044_DESC;Shcherbitsky's Purge now attacks the administration of the state. The population and even the whole world seems to finally realize that something is changing in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the conditions for entering the bureaucracy have been broadened in order to hire people on their skills. Of course, the party makes sure that all these people remain loyal to the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001045_DESC;In order to ensure the loyalty of the party and to fill the vacant positions, the General Secretary has appointed a new Second Secretary. He will make sure that the new politburo members are young and, above all, loyal to the new leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001046_DESC;Shcherbitsky's Purge seems to be over and a strict protocol was put in place to check the loyalty, competence and non-corruption of its members and can affect anyone. Even General Secretary Shcherbitsky was affected by his investigations and published the results in Pravda. Yet, although the main figure of reformism in the USSR has been eliminated, Gorbachev stands out and manages to gather a small faction within the party. He poses no threat to the future of the country because Gorbachev has neither the position nor the skills to conduct an effective opposition policy. It remains to be seen whether one wishes to eliminate all opposition or simply leave it in its corner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001048_DESC;The economy of the Soviet Union has been stagnant for several years and economic reforms are needed. With his administrative talents, Vladimir Shcherbitsky began to undertake economic reforms that focused on the well-being of the population and better organization of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001049_DESC;In order to better organize the Soviet economy, a proposal is increasingly making its way within the Politburo: the partial automation of the economy. Although this does not please one part of the party, it would facilitate and simplify the organization of workers by improving the quality of goods. But only the Secretary General can decide to adopt this proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001050_DESC;To conclude the economic reforms and still with a view to reform the economy of the USSR, Vladimir Scherbitsky organized a special meeting with the various leaders of the Eastern bloc to strengthen economic ties between the communist countries. This should lead to an economic boom in the whole region and greatly help the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001064_DESC;While small political reforms are underway, debates are taking place within the party as to whether more power should be given to the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest legislative institution. Some members of the party would like, under Leninism, to see the Supreme Soviet become a true legislative body, in which laws would be discussed by the party in this assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001065_DESC;A new question arises with regard to the place of the media. Should we always keep a control on the media by influencing them, in order to avoid the spread of any anti-Soviet propaganda, or do we give them frankly more freedom to let the people express themselves as they wish ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001066_DESC;The trade unions under the Soviet Union, led by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, had a complex relationship with industry, the Communist Party and the government, since the Soviet Union was ideologically supposed to be a state in which working class members ran the country and themselves. It is the turn of the Syndicate to undergo a new debate in the party, should we give more power to opposition syndicates in the name of individual and collective liberties or do we always keep some control over them by influencing them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001067_DESC;The question of nationalities within the Soviet Union has always been a thorny issue. The problem is still present and is even growing and could lead to problems. Should we just repress its movements and monitor them closely or should we stop this policy of Russification of peoples and recognize the true equality of peoples?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001068_DESC;A new congress begins today, but not an ordinary one, because it is broadcast live on Soviet television and shows a new face of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the various reforms of our leader, the USSR has been able to evolve while remaining faithful to the principles of the Communist Party. The Soviet Union seems to stand, more stable than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001069_DESC;Comrade Vladimir Shcherbitsky, General Secretary of the CPSU died, leaving behind him a Soviet Union stronger internationally, was able to reorganize the country's economy while getting rid of corruption. Whatever happens, the whole country mourns a great man and even countries, such as China or other communist parties, which had stopped being loyal to the USSR, came to bid him a final farewell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001090_DESC;Comrade Viktor Grishin, leader of the Soviet Union, has died. He was throughout his life a convinced Brezhnevist and continued to apply his policy when he took power after the death of Chermenko. The country is no longer as stable as when he took power, and the economic power of the country has become even weaker. The rise to power of the Reformists became inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001092_DESC;The election of Grigory Romanov as Secretary General was made possible by the support of Andrei Gromyko. Without this, the reformist Mikhail Gorbachev could have obtained the post by taking advantage of the confusion of Chermenko's death. This is proof that Gorbachev's supporters only want power and not the success of the communist cause, so it is essential to get rid of them as soon as possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001094_DESC;In order to ensure that he would never again be subjected to this attempted takeover by the reformists, Grigori set up a system of ideological examination within the party to make sure that every member was a convinced communist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001095_DESC;Well aware that the bureaucracy has taken too great a place in the country and that it no longer relies on their achievements. The General Secretary Grigory Romanov begins to put more discipline, people are chosen for skills and employment in the party and in the administration is no longer guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001096_DESC;The question of nationalism has always been a problem for the USSR. In recent years, nationalism seems to be starting to gain strength again. Faced with this problem, we can either stifle them again or ensure the equality of peoples through political reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001097_DESC;Soviet Jews, deemed "cosmopolitan," were considered a security risk or potential traitors. Some were arrested, or punished in other ways, for daring to express a desire to leave the country for the West, which was seen as a confirmation of suspicions about their lack of loyalty. However, with the assumption of power by Grigori Romanov, who was a notorious anti-Semite, discriminatory and stigmatizing practices for this people could reappear. It remains to be seen whether the Secretary General will put his opinions aside or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001098_DESC;Grigory Romanov was certainly in favor of reforming the Soviet economy, but had a different vision from other party members. Indeed, in addition to wanting to improve the management of the party, he wanted to set up an automation of the country. The problem was the courage to find enough support in the party, the administration and the army to ensure such an undertaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001106_DESC;In the same way as in Leningrad, Grigory Romanov started to build scientific complexes all over the country in order to help the economic development of the country but also to help in research and try to catch up with the accumulated technological backlog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001107_DESC;Paradoxically enough, while many people see the new Secretary General as a tough person, some concessions of censorship in the creative sector are made. This resulted in the creation of new music clubs and filmmakers became freer to experiment with new genres.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001099_DESC;It is time to examine the situation with COMECON. To ensure the loyalty of its countries to the Soviet Union and its interests, a meeting will soon be held to decide which way to go: Should we use the COMECON to the advantage of the USSR by forming an economic union, which would make the Eastern countries dependent on us, or should we take the example of the European model, with the creation of a central bank and everything that can go with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001102_DESC;Today, Grigory Romanov is dead. Despite the discontent of some people in the party, he managed, thanks to the automation of the economy, to reform and modernize the Soviet Union without its collapse. He did not stop protecting the interests of the Soviet Union, and increase its economic power and the welfare of the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001103_DESC;Today, Grigory Romanov is dead. However, despite his good management, both internally and externally, the economic and political situation of the country has improved but has not solved the problems. His death announces the return to power of reformists who want to make reforms as Andropov or Gorbachev had done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001104_DESC;Andrei Gromyko never really liked doctors. Already in 1986, after a serious flu illness and a developed intoxication, Gromyko suffered a clinical cardiac arrest and managed to be brought back to life in extremis. However, the pain that the General Secretary has seems more serious and he might not survive if nothing is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001105_DESC;July 1989, Gromyko, not wanting to disturb his sleeping relatives, endured a sharp pain in the chest until the morning and by the time they realized it, it was already too late for the doctor and the General Secretary died suddenly while still reforming the Soviet Union. After a farewell ceremony was held to pay tribute to him as a respected Secretary General and diplomat, a new meeting to choose a new leader was held. Two candidates claimed the position: Mikhail Gorbachev, a reformist and several times pretender to the post, and Egor Ligachev, a former ally of Gorbachev, but with Gromyko in power, he was able to show notable differences between them, especially on the economic level, making him a moderate reformist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001108_DESC;With the aim of modernizing the Soviet Union by introducing liberalism. Andrei Gromyko presents a new economic form called "Planned Economy with Market Elements". Contrary to what one might think, this is not a policy like in China with Deng Xiaoping, but a new practice that consists of keeping the Soviet economic system (planned economy) but the government will now allow the population to own their small business, still controlled by the state, and even to be able to direct a small profit. The goal is to give more economic freedom to the population and to the government to find money easily while trying to scuttle the black market that reigns in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001109_DESC;Several months after the launch of this concept, we can see that Gromyko's goal is being accomplished. Small and medium-sized enterprises began to flourish all over the Soviet Union. Certainly, a minority within the party and the population demanded more freedom, but for the vast majority of the population, the fact that they could own a small business and make a living from it while having the comforts offered by the Soviet government made the measure very popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001110_DESC;Today, the government announced new economic reforms to make the Soviet regime more flexible. Its first announcement is on price policy. Indeed, as the Soviet Union is a planned economy and the vast majority of needs are provided by the state, the currency was not really "conventional" money and was not even used for exchange even within the country. Should we set up a currency that is always under our control but that can fluctuate according to the demand or should we go further by starting to control only the first necessities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001111_DESC;It is time to decide on the policy we have with the workers. Should we formalize Andropov's policy by disciplining workers by ensuring the quality of their work that they are all sufficiently competent and useful for the country in the position they occupy or should we go further by declaring that the workers are free, which would involve introducing notions that were unknown to the Soviet people such as the labor contract and etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001112_DESC;And finally, trade policy. It is above all a question of knowing how much we want to open ourselves to the world: a selective protectionism, although we are open, the importation of foreign product, especially those of the capitalists, will be overtaxed or a limited protectionism where our openness to the world is. larger and more flexible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001113_DESC;A news has just been announced with surprise. In coordination with the USSR and all the countries of Eastern Europe, it was decided to open the borders with the communist countries and to set up an immigration quota for the outside. Looks like the Iron Curtain is starting to open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001114_DESC;In order to facilitate economic exchanges between communist countries, some people have hypothesized the creation of a central bank to better control our monetary policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001115_DESC;With the reform of COMECON into an economic organization standardizing the economy of all the countries of Eastern Europe with the USSR, we will henceforth be able to trade among ourselves and ensure certain forms of economic stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001116_DESC;After the successful implementation of economic reforms by the Gromyko government, it is high time to tackle political reforms in order to liberalize the Soviet Union and to give it a more human face on the international level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001117_DESC;The first reform that is on the table is the reform of the legislative policy. Although there is a parliament (Supreme Soviet), it is in fact controlled by the Communist Party, and they make the laws in the whole country. Does the Party still have this privilege or is the legislative power returned to the Supreme Soviet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001118_DESC;This issue is likely to be a little more thorny, that of elections. Theoretically, elections existed in the USSR, but it was only a façade. This time it is a question of how far we want to go with these elections: Does the Party let the people choose their candidates or do we hold contested elections within the Party?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001119_DESC;A new thorny issue will take place, it is the issue of freedom of the press. Even if the Secretary General wants to grant more freedom, he has not necessarily indicated how far he wants to go. Some members want to continue to control the media while others want to grant more freedom but make sure that no anti-revolutionary propaganda is published.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001120_DESC;The influence of the army in the Soviet economy has always been very large, and conscription plays an important role in it, since every man of age to enlist in the army for at least 2 years. To symbolize the decrease of the influence of the army, the General Secretary made the proposal to reduce the duration of conscription. However, some proposed to stop the military service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001121_DESC;The trade unions under the Soviet Union, led by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, had a complex relationship with industry, the Communist Party and the government, since the Soviet Union was ideologically supposed to be a state in which working class members ran the country and themselves. However, still in this desire to liberalize the country, the question is how far we want to go with the reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001122_DESC;The Soviet Union has many ethnicities which has always been a problem for the country and has always applied, as under the Russian Empire, a Russian-speaking policy to try to assimilate all its people. In recent years, however, more and more inter-ethnic conflicts, should we stop this Russian-speaking policy and really apply an equality between the peoples or do we change nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001123_DESC;Today, an important event took place. Indeed, the Supreme Soviet has just adopted a new constitution, called $YEAR$ Constitution, and it grants a little more political, economic and societal freedom but still reminds the central role of the Communist Party in its institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001124_DESC;Comrade Andrei Gromyko, General Secretary of the CPSU, has just died of a heart attack. His death was considered inevitable for a long time but he managed to live long enough to modernize the Soviet Union without adopting radical reforms. The country still seems to be stable and still holds a prominent place as a superpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001125_DESC;After long debate within the Party to determine the liberalization of the country's economy, the proposal of Gorbachev (Perestroika) was not retained, deemed too radical, in profile of that of Ligachev. From now on, the government announces the return of the NEP. The state will allow the population to create small or large enterprises in specific areas and will also encourage self-management of enterprises. This policy is criticized by some conservatives and the General Secretary recalled that even Lenin had temporarily given in to capitalism in order to revitalize the Soviet economy. It remains to be seen whether this policy will be effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001126_DESC;Many companies have been opened very quickly throughout the country, the benefits to the state has also increased ... However, many people have also made a lot of profit from this policy to the extent that they are beginning to have political clout. Some people even talk about the birth of an oligarchy within the Soviet Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001127_DESC;After the introduction of liberalism in the Soviet Union under the government of Ligachev, it is time to start political reform of the country and give it a more human face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001128_DESC;Surprisingly enough, General Secretary Egor Ligachev announced his resignation on television, explaining that his departure is above all a political rather than a forced retirement. The situation of the Soviet Union is not brilliant, the attempt to return to the NEP, with the establishment of cooperatives and a strong decentralization has caused the emergence of an oligarchy and the decline in the production of consumer goods. His attempt to open up the political scene allowed people like Boris Yeltsin to enter the legal opposition, which further weakened the unity of the Party. Although Ligachev more or less controlled the situation, economists warn that a major crisis is possible...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001129_DESC;On August 17, members of the GKChP met in Moscow and studied the treaty document. They believed that the pact would pave the way for the breakup of the Soviet Union and decided that it was time to act. The next day, Baklanov, Boldin, Shenin and General Varennikov visited Gorbachev at his dacha in Crimea in the hope of persuading him to declare a state of emergency and "restore order." In the end, the meeting came to nothing, Gorbachev will conclude it by saying: "Go to hell, do what you want. But report my opinion!". On August 19, at 1 am, Gennady Yanayev signed the decree on the entry into office of the President of the USSR and of the State Committee for the State of Emergency, composed of Yanayev, Pavlov, Kryuchkov, Yazov, Pogo, Bahlanov, Tizyakov and Starodubtsev.  It is time to launch the loyalist troops, but the question remains how to deploy the army.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001130_DESC;The troops were positioned as we wanted them to be, even though we encountered unexpected problems such as the population not openly supporting what was seen as a Putsch, everything went as planned. However, Vladimir Kryuchkov, head of the KGB, has just learned from the Alpha Group that Boris Yeltsin was leaving his cottage for Moscow to gather his supporters to fight the attempted coup.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001131_DESC;Around 11 am, on the Square of Manage, people with tricolor flags and portraits of Sakharov and Yeltsin begin to gather. Deputies and the Moscow City Council call for an unlimited strike. Since we control the TV center, maybe we should use it to try to calm down the crowds.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001132_DESC;A press conference was organized in the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, composed of Yanayev, Baklanov, Pugo, Starodubtsev and Tizyakova. One of the organizers of the Emergency Committee, Prime Minister, Pavlov, was absent after being hospitalized the day before due to alcohol poisoning. Everyone was nervous, especially Yanayev where everyone could see his shaking hands. During the conference, one person asked our position on the future policy of the country. Should we disown Gorbachev's reforms or not? Or do we make a more original proposal?;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001133_DESC;While Gennady Yanayev appointed General Kalinin as the military commander of Moscow and declared a curfew in Moscow from 11 p.m. to 5 p.m., starting August 20, this was understood as a sign that the attack on the White House. On August 20, around noon, it is estimated that more than 200 000 people gathered around the White House. The rally lasted five hours and many people took the opportunity to make speeches from the balcony. The House of Soviets has become the center of opposition. We must resolve this situation before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001134_DESC;The whole world is wondering what is really happening to Gorbachev. We must decide urgently what to do with him and what to tell the people.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001135_DESC;Seeing that he no longer controls anything, Gorbachev agrees to sign documents in which he withdraws from all positions and transfers power to us. In return, he asks that he can leave the country without a scratch with his wife.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001136_DESC;Gorbachev refused to sign any document and that he only wanted to sign the new treaty. The Committee leaves this exchange with a greater confusion. The members do not really know how to react, even members Dmitry Yazov begins to have a defeatist spirit.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001137_DESC;The Emergency Committee on a State of Emergency did everything it could to try to save the Soviet Union. The only way to know if their coup attempt is successful is if it is validated by the White House (or House of Soviets). All that remains is to wait for the result...;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001138_DESC;The White House has just declared the provisional government as unconstitutional and illegal. Therefore, the police is sent to arrest the plotters. Kryuchkov, Yazov and Tizyakov are arrested during the morning, Pavlov, Vasily Starodubtsev, Baklanov, Boldin and Shenin are detained for 48 hours (although Pavlov will be hospitalized because of his illness) and Pugo will die with his wife the next day. The circumstances of Pugo's death are still debated, even if the majority speaks of a double suicide, some say that it was a murder. The immediate consequences are above all a considerable weakening of the CPSU and Gorbachev and a strengthening of the position of Boris Yeltsin and his supporters.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001139_DESC;After several days of pressure from the White House, they finally recognized the provisional government of the Emergency Committee as official. The population seems much more divided on the issue and the situation is far from stable. Meanwhile, Gennady Yanayev was appointed interim President of the USSR while the new government chose a new leader. It was also declared that the State of Emergency is extended for 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001140_DESC;During the following days, different countries around the world began to officially recognize the provisional government of the Emergency Committee. Finally, after only a few days, the White House recognized the Emergency Committee as official and decided to extend the State of Emergency for 5 years. Gennady Yanayev is recognized as the interim President for 6 months, the time for the new government to find a new leader.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001141_DESC;Vladimir Kryuchkov was the head of the KGB but also one of the "leaders" of the Emergency Committee. He was known as a hard-line communist who was always against Gorbachev's reforms. Now that he is in power, Kryuchkov cancels all the reforms undertaken so far and even seems to want to restore the communist regimes in Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001142_DESC;Gennady Yanayev was the President of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and reached the Politburo in 1990 thanks to Gorbachev. He joined the Emergency Committee and became its "official head". He is probably the least politicized member of the group and was chosen because, in addition to his growing doubts about Gorbachev's reforms, he was easily controlled by the real heads of the Emergency Committee, namely Vladimir Kryuchkov and Boris Pugo. However, Gennady Yanayev managed to gain enough trust and autonomy within the group to really come to power and assume the office of President of the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001143_DESC;Boris Pugo was the Minister of Internal Affairs and one of the "leaders" of the Emergency Committee, he was also, which is really rare to say, a pro-Soviet Union Latvian. Pugo was best known for being an ardent supporter of the anti-corruption cause, most notably for politically eliminating Grigory Luchansky, in a case of corruption of public property. Now that Pugo has been appointed as the new leader of the Soviet Union, he will be able to implement reforms following the example of Deng Xiaoping's China.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001144_DESC;Valentin Pavlov was the Prime Minister of the USSR, but he was best known for being the Chairman of the State Price Committee and then Minister of Finance. The reasons for Pavlov's participation in the Emergency Committee can be roughly summarized as follows: While Gorbachev planned to replace him as Prime Minister, Pavlov, who was close to the pro-Soviet Union faction, considered that Gorbachev held too much power and that some of his powers should be transferred to the post of Prime Minister and thus ensure a stable government. Gorbachev blocked the parliamentary vote, which was to his disadvantage, and this convinced Pavlov to join the coup, seeing Gorbachev as a threat to the integrity of the Union and unwilling to go further in the country's economic reforms. Now that Pavlov is the new leader of the Soviet Union, he has already implemented political and economic reforms to the point of transforming the country into a true Social Democracy.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_9001145_DESC;After the Emergency Committee took power and with the arrival of the new leader of the Soviet Union, a huge purge began to be organized throughout the country. The priority of the purges was to target Nationalists, Liberals and former pro-Gorbachevs, who were perceived as traitors.There are also many victims in the party cadres who participated in corruption cases, regardless of the merit of the position or not.;;;;;;;;;;X

collective_leadership;Collective Leadership;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001146_DESC;The concept of Collective Leadership was born after the death of Stalin, for fear of a return to the concentration of power in the hands of one man, and was a proposal of Georgy Malenkov, then Prime Minister of the country, and originally brought together Malenkov, Beria and Molotov. However, this 1st Collective Leadership collapsed when Malenkov and Molotov joined forces with Khrushchev and Zhukov to eliminate Beria, allowing Khrushchev to take power almost single-handedly. Over time, this notion spread throughout the communist countries and was seen as an ideal way of operating and managing. This mode of leadership will continue throughout the history of the Soviet Union until Gorbachev comes to power and Glasnost is introduced, forcing the members of the party leadership to openly disagree with Gorbachev's program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001147_DESC;Nikolai Podgorny participated in the coup against Nikita Khrushchev and was part of a Troika composed of himself, Alexei Kosygin, who became Prime Minister, and Leonid Brezhnev, who became Secretary General. He replaced Anastas Mikoyan in October 1964 as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a position that was mainly honorary but very important as it officially represented the Soviet Union internally and externally. Podgorny was, theoretically, superior to almost everyone and his liberal positions made him a choice opponent for conservatives and even some reformists. However, he retained a fairly high popularity among the population due to his numerous public appearances and even within the party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001148_DESC;The Sinyavsky-Daniel trial took place in 1966 in a particular context. After Khrushchev came to power, a relaxation of censorship was felt, intellectuals could talk about more sensitive subjects without allowing themselves to say or write anything about the party. This thaw even gave rise to a joke within the KGB that if the secret service were to arrest every person who made a joke about the General Secretary, there would be no inhabitants left in the USSR. However, after the coup, the conservatives, headed by Brezhnev, began to reapply a more repressive censorship policy using Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code, condemning all anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda. Scapegoats were found, Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel for publishing, under a pseudonym, satirical writings on Soviet life in other countries. We can still influence the judges and perhaps prevent the start of a new policy of massive repression against any form of opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001150_DESC;On January 22, 1969, a deserter from the Soviet army, Viktor Ilyin, irritated by his forced conscription and the events of the Prague Spring, decides to take two Makarov pistols and the police uniform of his brother-in-law to Moscow. At 2:15 p.m., a motorcade entered the Kremlin and Viktor Ilyin took out his pistol and started shooting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001197_DESC;Viktor Ilyin managed to shoot at the car with Leonid Brezhnev. The driver was killed and the General Secretary was seriously wounded and died in the following hours. The shooter was arrested and interrogated by the head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov, and explained his motivation. He will be executed in the following months for terrorism. The death of Brezhnev left a political vacuum among the conservatives, Mikhail Suslov became their unofficial leader but did not wish to get involved politically and was not unanimously supported. Alexei Kosygin was now the only important figure in the country and there was nothing will stop him in his desire to reform the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001198_DESC;Viktor Ilyin managed to shoot but got the wrong vehicle and the bullets managed to reach the car where cosmonauts returned from a previous mission are located. The driver will be killed but not the primary target. Arrested and questioned by the head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov, he said his motivation was to replace Brezhnev with Mikhail Suslov. It is still unknown today whether he had told the truth at the time, but he will be declared mad and will be interned at the Kazan psychiatric hospital until 1990. Long remained hidden, even among the soviet people, this attack will allow Leonid Brezhnev to strengthen his position within the party and to justify certain policies of repression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001196_DESC;On September 11, 1971, the General Secretary of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers died of a heart attack. Nikita Khrushchev was a person full of contradictions, although he denounced Stalin and his methods during the XXth Congress, the latter did not hesitate to use them against his own people or even to build the Berlin Wall. Although his agricultural program seemed good and ambitious, it turned out to be a damp squib and was mostly mismanaged. He succeeded in giving everyone in the Soviet Union a home, even if it was a low-cost building and mostly a temporary solution. He will mark the whole world for being seen as a special reformist, especially for his words and his uncertain speeches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001151_DESC;Although Kosygin never gained dominance over Brezhnev, the latter was still trying to reform the country's economy, this time by strengthening the powers and functions of the regional planners by creating associations. The newly created associations were to increase cooperation between enterprises, and each association was to be specialized in order to prevent each enterprise from being overwhelmed by excessive production. Although the conservatives are in a strong position, we can either slow down the reform so much that it will never be implemented or we can make Kosygin understand that he should stay in his place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001152_DESC;After the end of the Politburo reshuffle process, the Soviet leadership moved toward gerontocracy, a form of government in which the leaders are significantly older than most of the adult population. The majority of these appointees were of peasant or working-class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kossygin and Brezhnev are excellent examples of men appointed as a result of Stalin's Great Purge. Young politicians, such as Fyodor Kulakov and Grigory Romanov, were considered potential successors to Brezhnev, but none of them came close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001153_DESC;After the coup against Khrushchev, the cultural climate became more repressive. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was, under Khrushchev, a fairly popular author even if he was criticized. However, since the arrival of the conservatives, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's works quickly stopped and he began to work in secret and in constant fear of death on several works, one of the best known being The Gulag Archipelago. In 1969, he was expelled from the Writers' Union for his "anti-Soviet" writings. In 1970, he will receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, which will make him even more internationally known and his work on the Gulag will be released in the world (except in the USSR, of course) and will be a huge success. Today, the head of the KGB, makes the proposal to either eliminate him with poison or to expel him from the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001154_DESC;Andrei Sakharov was a great Soviet scientist who contributed a lot in the civil nuclear field (he is notably at the origin of the Tokamak, a controlled nuclear fusion reactor, still used in Russia and even in the world), and he will work especially on the RDS-37 project, the first Soviet H-bomb with stages, and on the Tsar Bomba. The proliferation of nuclear weapons in the USSR and in the world, as well as his moral involvement in his projects, will make him start to be politically active. He will enter in frank opposition with the Soviet government will be done in several stages, initially at the time of the attempt by Khrushchev of the election of Nikolai Nuzhdin, former disciple of Trofim Lyssenko, in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. Even if the nomination of Nikolai Nuzhdin will not be made, Sergey Khrushchev, son of Nikita Khrushchev, will order to the KGB to gather compromising information on Sakharov. Then, in 1967, when the ballistic missile defense became a key issue in the American-Soviet relations. In 1975 a Nobel Peace Prize that will make him even more known in the world. In 1976, Yuri Andropov was ready to call him "public enemy number 1". Attempting to kill him will never pass in the West, it is high time to isolate him from any form of life in the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001155_DESC;As early as 1970, Brezhnev had tried to politically eliminate Nikolai Podgorny because he held too strong a position in the state. This attempt to get Brezhnev to vote for more power was countered by Podgorny and Kosygin's supporters and went against the principle of Collective Leadership. But now that Brezhnev's power has grown stronger over the years, it is now possible to eliminate Podgorny. We can, of course, consider a more...traditional elimination, or we can accept Grigory Romanov's proposal to vote him out and change the constitution to make it more advantageous to Brezhnev and the conservatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001157_DESC;The 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union was unanimously adopted by the Supreme Soviet and replaced the 1936 Constitution. In addition to being more comprehensive, with 28 more articles than the previous constitution, it explicitly defined the division of responsibilities between the central government in Moscow and the republican governments. Among its additional articles was an old promise dating back to the very beginning of the October Revolution: Article 72, which theoretically allowed any republic to separate from the Union. The particularity, not much emphasized at the time, was the fact that the Preamble of the Constitution stated that "the objectives of the dictatorship of the proletariat having been achieved, the Soviet State has become the State of the whole people". This referred to Brezhnev's "Slogan", which allowed him to stay in power: "Communism has been achieved", which justified the laissez-faire economic and social situation of the country, today called "Era of Stagnation".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001158_DESC;The Economic Reform of 1979 will be the last attempt of Kosygin to reform the Soviet economy, which was aimed at "Improving planning and strengthening the effects of the economic mechanism on increasing the efficiency of production and improving the quality of work". The reform was never implemented and the little that was done only made the situation worse locally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001159_DESC;With the consolidation of Brezhnev's power, Kosygin's influence in the Politburo gradually waned during the 1970s and he was frequently hospitalized. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976 and his health deteriorated over the years. Finally in October 1980, Kosygin was hospitalized one last time. Well aware that his death was near, he quickly wrote a letter of resignation and almost immediately lost all government protection, communication and all the luxury goods he had earned during his political life. He finally died on December 18, 1980 and no Politubo college, former aides or security guards visited him. He represented the reformist line of the party and he put all his talent to try to reform the economy of the Soviet Union but was always prevented by the conservatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001160_DESC;Although he was closely linked to Stalin, Alexander Shelepin was not affected by the De-Stalinization and even became friends with Nikita Khrushchev. As First Secretary of the Komsomol, the youth organization of the Communist Party, he sent a lot of young communists during the Virgin Lands Campaign, which allowed him to become President of the KGB in 1958. Shelepin will deeply modify the methods of the KGB by replacing many agents by young academics and Komsomol, which will restore the public image of the Secret Service and will change its methods of approaches, less brutal. In 1961, he became First Deputy Prime Minister but put his protege, Vladimir Semichastny, in the position of President of the KGB. Despite all this, he will be one of the main plotters in the coup against Khrushchev in 1964. Now that Alexander Shelepin has become General Secretary of the CPSU, and leading a fairly large faction of the "hard line" party, the latter does not have enough influence in the army and within the party, which scares the middle manager with his ambitions, his vision for the development of the Soviet Union and the communist movement in general, but also by his requirement in the skills of party members. With Semichastny, it will be necessary to decide how to go about it so that he remains in power and clears his rival, Leonid Brejnev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001161_DESC;After a long discussion between the most loyal members of the party, it was decided that the easiest way to stay in power would be to use the army as a means of pressure on the party, failing to have a clearly established majority. It remains to be seen how the KGB can influence the Soviet army. Either we try to put pressure on them by using real or fake evidence on the Generals, but this strategy seems risky, or we try to influence them enough to make them support us or, simply, we organize a secret meeting with the Marshal and the Generals to find a compromise with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001162_DESC;After a long discussion between the most loyal members of the party, it was decided that the easiest way to stay in power would be to have a clearly established majority within the party in order to ensure some form of stability. The question is how the KGB can influence the party. Either we try to pressure them by using real or fake evidence on the most imminent cadres and members, but this strategy seems risky, or we try to influence them enough to support us, or we simply organize a secret meeting with the other Brezhnev rivals to find a compromise with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001163_DESC;Shelepin, with the help of the KGB, managed to keep himself in power by politically eliminating Brezhnev. Now that Alexander Shelepin has become the de facto leader of the Soviet Union, he will finally be able to realize his ambitions for the Soviet Union and for the communist movement in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001164_DESC;Unfortunately, the attempt to keep Shelepin in power could not be realized because of Brezhnev's already too great influence. Brezhnev's conservatives really took the upper hand over Shelepin's faction and the latter was politically eliminated over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001165_DESC;The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) took place in Moscow, RSFSR between 29 March and 8 April 1966. It was the first Congress since the withdrawal of Khrushchev. This Congress will offer places to personalities in key positions, such as Shelepin, Kosygin and others. But it is important because it will determine the new five-year plan of the USSR. Kosygin and his supporters propose to study the proposals of Libermann, an economist. However, Alexander Shelepin, recently seduced by the proposals of the cybernetics, puts forward the idea of automating the economy of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001166_DESC;After a lengthy debate, a vote was taken by show of hands and Shelepin's proposal passed with a majority. With the support of his faction, a huge budget was released, starting with the widespread use of computers. The final goal will be to create a computer network linked throughout the country and calculating in real time the production and all other forms of information. The OGAS Project seems to have started well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001167_DESC;After a long debate, a vote was held by show of hands and Kosygin's proposal passed with a fairly close majority. This reform would give greater management autonomy to companies (freedom to set prices and wages, to hire, to order...). It will be first tested in the Shchyokinsky chemical plant. However, this reform met with resistance from conservatives because it required the party to loosen its grip on the Soviet economy and feared that this would lead to the emergence of a kind of technocracy capable of challenging their decisions, powers and privileges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001168_DESC;Kosygin's reforms turn out to be a failure. In addition to not solving the problems raised, but this leads to an increase in imports, especially wheat, for the Soviet Union. We can take the advantage in this situation and bring Shelepin's proposals back to the forefront and silence reformist Kosygin and his supporters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001169_DESC;With the coming to power of Shelepin, a recentralization of power could be observed, whether by the party, the population but even outside. Theoretically, the Soviet Union still claims to be a federation where each republic can vote laws and so on. but in fact, all decisions are taken in Moscow with the approval of the Secretary General. Some observers are starting to talk about "Fake Federation".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001201_DESC;When Shelepin was Chairman of the KGB under Khrushchev, he proposed the destruction of numerous documents related to the Katyn massacre of Polish officers in order to minimize the chances of the truth being revealed. Finally, even the destruction of the file had already started, it never succeeded. Now that Shelepin is the leader of the USSR, he has the possibility of actually destroying all evidence of this massacre and never being able to really indict the Soviet power in this matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001170_DESC;Today, the Secretary General has succeeded in passing an administrative reform in order to make it much more efficient. Indeed, from now on, the members of the bureaucracy will be based on precise selection criteria, and no longer only on party membership or not, and the benefits that will be given to bureaucrats will be framed according to their performance and especially their skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001171_DESC;A new institution has just been born in the Soviet Union, the "Disciplinary Committee of the CPSU". Supervised by the KGB, this committee will be in charge of constantly monitoring the efficiency of the Soviet administration and exposing cases of corruption. Besides improving the quality of the administration, the exposure of corruption cases made the institution more popular with the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001172_DESC;In recent years, a phenomenon has started to appear in the USSR. More and more citizens are just starting to enjoy the benefits of Soviet society without fulfilling their duty like going to work, without being told anything. To avoid a future disaster, Alexandre Shelepin asked the KGB to survey the streets and the countryside and verify that each citizen is doing his job, this can go as far as removing certain advantages. If some Communists criticize this policy, this helps to ensure the efficiency of the workers and to avoid what Shelepin now calls "parasitism".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001173_DESC;Although Leonid Brezhnev no longer had as much influence in the party, he still had a great presence and still had a small faction of followers around him. We can decide to leave him in his position, of course, but we can decide to eliminate him permanently. There are several possibilities: Either we can send him to an insignificant position, as a factory manager in a distant republic, or, simply, banish him from the party. However, the head of the KGB brought clear evidence of corruption, worse, Brezhnev bought a large amount of Western cars on the black market. This is the ideal evidence to get rid of him and to legitimize Alexander Shelepin's fight against corruption and the fight against "parasitism".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001174_DESC;Comrade Alexander Shelepin, General Secretary of the CPSU, has died. Although he represented the hard line of the party, because of his demands or his will to spread communism in the world. Although he was criticized by some members of the party, all those who worked closely or distantly with him became his most loyal supporters. Now that he is dead, his idea of automating the Soviet economy through the OGAS Project is not yet accomplished. Should we continue his work or not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001200_DESC;After the death of Leonid Brezhnev, the conservatives were considerably weakened, although still present. Even if Podgorny occupies an important place, Alexei Kosygin is the one who is the most unanimous within the party. Thus, even if Kosygin is not the General Secretary, he places at its head Dmitry Polyansky, one of his greatest loyalists, and becomes de facto head of the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001175_DESC;During a visit to East Germany, Kosygin takes the opportunity to make a surprise announcement that the Soviet Union will begin to open up commercially to other countries and encourages other Eastern European countries to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001177_DESC;Now that Kosygin was in control of the country, he could finally reform the country's economy, this time by strengthening the powers and functions of regional planners through the creation of associations. The newly created associations were to increase cooperation among enterprises, and each association was to be specialized to prevent each enterprise from being overwhelmed by excessive production. The question remains as to what this reform should prioritize. Either we give the people more economic freedom or we take the opportunity to just improve living standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001178_DESC;Since the death of Brezhnev and Kosygin's rise to power, General Secretary Dmitry Polyansky has taken advantage of his position to recruit young communists with reformist ideas into the Politburo and the Supreme Soviet. Of course, this does not please the conservatives and in the place of debate, we see violent arguments between party members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001179_DESC;During Khrushchev Thaw, a limited form of censorship in the cultural sphere was established, which allowed some foreign films, books, art and music to be opened to the Soviet society and some authors, who were previously forbidden, were able to appear without any censorship. After the coup against Khrushchev, a certain form of censorship was revived under the influence of conservatives. However, now that Kosygin is in power and the conservatives are weakened, it is possible to restore this policy without any fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001181_DESC;The importance of the army in the politics of the communist party already played an important role before the 1940s, but its role became indispensable since the WWII and especially since the beginning of the Cold War in which a large part of the country's budget was reserved for the army. Although popular at the end of the WWII, its popularity decreased with time and the budget reserved for the army became a subject of debate within the party. We can decide to keep this form of army under permanent construction by investing a lot of money in it, or we can decide that the army will only play a defensive role for the maintenance of the Soviet Union and take advantage of this to decrease the duration of conscription.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001182_DESC;The leader of the Soviet Union, in a speech on television, announced that the party would work on a major political reform to liberalize the country. No one knows yet what it might be, but it is certain that the population is talking a lot and this reform seems to raise a lot of expectations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001183_DESC;Shortly after the announcement of a major political reform and the first debates, the conservatives began to denounce a desire to destroy the Soviet Union. Becoming more and more vocal, it became urgent to find a way to silence these dinosaurs that only slowed down the policy of the reformers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001184_DESC;If until now Alexei Kosygin and Nikolai Podgorny were able to agree on the line to follow, with the elimination of the conservatives, their differences have come to light. Podgorny wanted the political reforms to go further and give the Soviet people more freedom, while Kosygin considered that it was necessary to be more cautious and pragmatic and that the party should always keep some control over the situation. Although torn, the party must now decide who to support and what direction to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001185_DESC;The Constitution of the Soviet Union of $YEAR$, with the great support of Kosygin's supporters, has just been adopted by the Supreme Soviet, which officially holds the legislative power and where the next laws will actually be voted. More freedoms have been granted to the Soviet population and, surprisingly, an old promise from the October Revolution has been fulfilled. From now on, the Soviet Union becomes a Confederation in which each republic can become independent, although the process of independence is filled with certain conditions, it could cause problems if we do not keep some control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001187_DESC;Incorporated shortly before World War II and as required by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Baltic States were incorporated into the Soviet Union after a long and violent incorporation process. However, the population of these countries have always perceived the USSR as an invader and since the adoption of the new Constitution, these countries have requested independence from Moscow. Should we accept this request, find some kind of compromise or simply betray what we have established?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001188_DESC;Agriculture has always been a problem in the USSR, not being able to meet the demands of the population, and even if there are no more famines, problems of shortage still persist. We now have the opportunity to try to introduce the Hungarian model by decentralizing the management of collective farms and state farms, creating agricultural cooperatives based on family contracts and individual exploitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001190_DESC;Kirill Mazurov was an important figure in Soviet Belarus and is still highly respected in his home country. Since he came to power in Belarus in 1956, he remained in Minsk and continued to develop his country both in the mining industry and in agriculture. We can reward Mazurov for his deserved efforts or we can show the world the Belarusian model and where the Soviet Union wants to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001192_DESC;From 1976, with the first heart attack of Alexei Kosygin, this one will go more and more to the hospital, so much so that Kosygin will find a replacement under the name of Kirill Mazurov. This one will take more and more place and is now seen as his successor. And when Alexei Kosygin dies on December 18, 1980, a huge tribute is paid throughout the country and is considered a great reformer and having contributed much to his country. From now on, it is enough to find a successor, even if Kirill Mazurov is in a very good position, Yuri Andropov claims to be the leader of the Soviet Union, wishing to go further in the political and especially economic reforms of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001186_DESC;The Constitution of the Soviet Union of $YEAR$, with a small majority under the influence of Podgorny, is adopted by the new assembly of the USSR, the Supreme Soviet. Great political freedom was granted to the Soviet population, since an old promise dating back to the October Revolution was fulfilled, transforming the USSR into a Confederation, allowing each republic that wished to become independent. Even if it is not registered, Podgorny made the population promise free and fair elections!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001195_DESC;The head of state of the USSR, Nikolai Podgorny, died. He was considered the most liberal of the reformers and wanted to satisfy the population with the increase of consumer goods. His death meant the beginning of free elections in the whole country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001202_DESC;Although Kosygin's Agricultural Reform has brought about an advance in agriculture, problems still persist. The new Secretary General, Kirill Mazurov, has the ambition to build on the work of his predecessor to solve the problem of agriculture in the Soviet Union once and for all. For this, we have two approaches, either we learn from our mistakes and we take advantage of it to revive the Virgin Lands Campaign but on a scientific basis, or we ask our scientists to find a solution in order to quickly compensate our shortcomings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001203_DESC;At a session of the Plenum of the Central Committee, General Secretary Krill Mazurov a Food Program to improve and improve the conditions of Soviet agriculture by improving the planning mechanism. To achieve this goal, the local bureaucracy was reorganized to increase its efficiency, new roads will be built and new equipment will be distributed to peasants. The supervision of this project will be the Secretary of the Central Committee responsible for Agriculture, Mikhail Gorbachev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001204_DESC;A surprising news has just been announced to the people, the launch of a new Virgin Lands Campaign. This time, the government will avoid the mistakes of Khrushchev and will be based on scientific studies, the campaign will be done gradually and according to the number of participants in the project, infrastructure and equipment. The SSR of Kazakhstan welcomes the news with enthusiasm, dreaming of being able to work on this project again and many volunteers are already flocking from all over the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001205_DESC;It was finally decided that it was necessary to compensate for the shortages as a matter of priority, for this purpose a new branch in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union with the best specialists was created in order to find a solution as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001206_DESC;Ivan Michurin was a Soviet arborist and an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences. He is the founding father of scientific agricultural breeding and worked on hybridization of plants of similar and different origins. He introduced more than 300 new varieties and received the Order of Lenin's Red Flag of Labor for his achievements. Recently, our scientists have been studying the work of Comrade Michurin and although some aspects of his work need to be revised, the essence of his work is still relevant and our scientists report that the best way is to follow his teachings and to develop genetics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001207_DESC;After years of development, the first Soviet GMOs were created, allowing the creation of many varieties of plants very quickly. Faced with this success, it was decided to generalize this practice throughout the Soviet Union, which will allow an enormous agricultural and scientific advance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001208_DESC;During his rule in Belarus, Mazurov allowed the rehabilitation of many party and state figures, underground fighters from Minsk and guerrilla commanders, which led to a certain political relaxation in Belarus compared to the rest of the Union. Now that he is in power, a "political" amnesty is possible, but it remains to be seen what kind of personality we want to free. Either we release political figures who have been judged too harshly or we release intellectuals and authors for the same reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001209_DESC;Alcohol has always played an important role in the population and different regimes have tried to deal with the problem in different ways. However, since the 70's, the consumption of alcohol has increased, reaching a historical record, it is necessary to act urgently and several solutions are offered to us: Either we ban alcohol, as in the time of the Russian Empire, or we start an anti-alcohol campaign to encourage people to consume less, or, a more original proposal, we increase the price of alcohol. In addition to encouraging people to consume less alcohol, we have an additional source of income.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001210_DESC;Roads in the Soviet Union were not as developed as in the Western Bloc for several reasons: It was better to use public transportation, the government did not necessarily have the money to have roads everywhere, the climate of the country does not help, anyway, for the construction of roads and especially, the USSR had the technology to build tanks but not for "civil" vehicles (Especially since the car procession was considered a bourgeois whim). It is only with the arrival to power of Khrushchev, and with the help of Fiat, that the construction of cars was possible and these last ones answered the soviet criterion, that is to say, not or afraid of maintenance, easy to manufacture or to repair and all-terrain. However, due to the demand of the population to have a vehicle, Mazurov would like to realize one of the wishes of Khrushchev, that everyone has a car. We can, of course, just improve the roads or improve them and then liberalize the sale of vehicles for civilians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001211_DESC;Comrade Kirill Mazurov, General Secretary of the CPSU, died leaving behind him a reformed and modernized Soviet Union. Even if some problems remain, most of the work has been done and reformers like Gorbachev wanting to go further are considered too radical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
