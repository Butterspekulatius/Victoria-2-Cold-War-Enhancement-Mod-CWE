### On the issue of in-game music ###

The mod file downloaded from this website does not contain any music other than the main menu theme. 

To get music to play mid-game, the CWE Music Addon Pack must be downloaded. This was done to avoid exceeding the Moddb upload size limit.

The music pack contains an assortment of 96 songs for a better Cold War immersion.

### How to install the CWE Music Addon Pack ###

Step 1: Download the Github zip file containing the music files from the following Github page: https://github.com/settintotrieste/CWE-Music-Addon-Pack or alternatively, Moddb at https://www.moddb.com/mods/victoria-2-cold-war-enhancement-mod/downloads/cwe-music-addon-pack

Step 2: Extract out the 'music' folder in the zip file.

Step 3: Copy and paste the 'music' folder from the zip file in Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod\CWE

Step 4: When the message to "replace file" pops-up, click okay to replace the existing 'music' file in the CWE programs folder.

Enjoy!
