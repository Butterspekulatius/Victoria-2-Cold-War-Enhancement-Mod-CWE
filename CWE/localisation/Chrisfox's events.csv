study_juche_desc;The DPRK has an interesting ideology - it incorporates elements of strong nationalism with a socialist system.

EVTDESC8012026;With the success of Che's revolutionaries in toppling the Bolivian government and the already chaotic situation in Peru, the charismatic figure has decided to try his luck in yet another South American nation. While he faces many of the same challenges as he did in Bolivia, the now stronger, more well funded, and hardened fighters are sure to cause trouble in their quest to paint the Americas red.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012027;With Fujimori's reign now at an end, Peru is once again able to choose its own leaders. In the immediate aftermath of the end of the dictatorship elections have been called and already two parties have emerged to the forefront, the Progressive 'Possible Peru' led by Toledo and the traditional left-wing party in the nation APRA hoping to secure its place in government once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012028;2006 marked the first serious attempt at the Ethnocacerists to achieve power through democratic means. Having joined the UPP earlier explicitly to run in the elections Ollanta faces stern opposition from the now much more reestablished traditional party on the left - the APRA. Constant associations with his brother Antauro, who had led an attempted uprising just a year before, and accusations of authoritarian rhetoric plagued Ollanta's campaign - almost assuring a loss in the run-offs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012029;Peruvians return to the polls once again, this time with more contention on the ballot than ever before since the end of the dictatorship. Currently the two candidates leading the polls are the 'Peruvian Nationalist Party' candidate Ollanta and the daughter of the former dictator, Keiko Fujimori represented by a party built around the ideology of the aforementioned dictator. This election pits two fears against one another; the fear of a return to the Fujimorism of the 90s, or an uncertain future with Ollanta who has previously expressed adherence to the radical 'Ethnocacerist' ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012030;In 2009 a decision by the government to allow oil companies to exploit resources in the amazon the local Indigenous people sparked a campaign of civil disobedience and advocacy that would last for more than a year and result in the government declaring martial law in the region as well as curtailing civil liberties to attempt to quell unrest - part of a larger political crisis in Peru spurred on by a free trade agreement with the US. As the situation worsened, the military was eventually called into the Bagua province where a main bulk of the protests were occurring in what became known as the 'Baguazo'. What would follow were two days of violence between government forces and the protesters, resulting in dozens of lives lost and many more wounded. The incident would go on to destabilize the already shaky government further - leading to resignations and a repeal of the laws that led to the protests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012031;The ICC has finally released its judgement on the long-standing dispute over the maritime borders of Peru and Chile. What has been a point of contention between the two countries since after their independence was deferred to the international community for an official solution back in 2008 in - Peru's hope - securing the nation a win against its long-time rival. The decision, however, has dashed said hopes as a solution neither country had argued in favor of was brought to the table. Rather than recognizing the boundaries set by Chile or forcing a secession of the areas claimed by Peru a new boundary has been set attempting to accommodate both claims by drawing the new boundaries between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012033;Desiring a stronger and more united Peru, the ability to stand up more firmly to American imperialism, and wishing to keep to some principles of his self-ascribed ethnocacerist ideology - Humala has today announced the start of talks with Bolivia in hopes of deepening cooperation between the two nations. Mainly focusing on resistance to neo-colonialism and imperialism, the talks also touch on the possibility of reviving a confederation between the two nations. While Morales and Humala share a fairly good relationship, it is highly unlikely that such a massive shift in South America will come from these talks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012034;Peru's new president has come to us today in attempts to start talks on the revival of a union between our two states. Humala, who styles his ideology similar to that of MAS, claims that united our two nations can better protect their people from foreign imperialism and make a stronger impact on the region. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012035;Bolivia today has made history by accepting the proposal for our two states to become one once again! A long road lies ahead, but our two peoples shall walk it united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012100;In the midst of Peru's 'Internal Wars' a strange new line of thought seems to be emerging among both soldiers and civilians alike. While in its infancy, these ideals seem to put themselves in opposition to the line and doctrine that the government has taken towards the Indigenous and disputed lands - blending Indigenous thought together with left-wing economics and right-wing nationalism. It remains to be seen whether this new ideology is a threat - however it seems a new front to the war with the Shining Path could soon emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012101;Ethnocacerism, otherwise known as the 'Peruvian Nationalist Movement' is an ideology that coalesced out of and in response to the 'Internal Wars' in Peru. In particular as a reaction to the military doctrine that treated many Indigenous communities as foreign territories. Claiming to be neither on the right or left, the movement embraces a third positionist stance that heavily ties itself to nationalism and a unique form of 'Indigenismo'. While the exact aims, policies, and positions of the group differ wildly, the common theme is the supremacy of the Indigenous groups in the country - and neighbouring countries, as 'Heirs of the Inca' and the need to establish a regime that is led by and represents the interests of this community while resisting foreign influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012102;The 'Levantamiento de Locumba', sometimes just known as the 'Locumbazo', was an attempt by the brothers Ollanta and Antauro Humala to force the resignation of the Fujimori regime in the dying day's of the dictator's regime. The brothers and their followers would go across Peru denouncing the government and spreading their message until their eventual arrest. While the uprising would be unsuccessful as such, those arrested would eventually be freed and Fujimori himself would resign only a mere three weeks later. This event also brought the Humala family more into the light of Peruvian society, and the 'Ethnocacerist Movement' they espoused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012103;In January of 2005, hoping to take advantage of the low approval of Peru's new president and in protest to perceived 'selling out' of the nation to nations like the US and Chile, Antauro Humala and several of his followers occupied a police station in Andahuaylas and began a small-scale uprising against the government.  Previously part of the 'Locumbazo Uprising', the revolutionary nationalist figure would see less success on his second attempt at ousting the government as his coup began to quickly fall apart. While having more followers than during Locumbazo, his forces were eventually forced into surrender by the government after some bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012104;Antauro Humala, one of the leaders of the Ethnocacerist Movement within Peru, has recently published a book outlining his views and aims for the movement. This text helps to clarify its points and frames the ideology in context of other Indigenous movements across the Americas; setting it to other streams of thought as well as outlining and refining its goals and aims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012105;With the 'Locumbazo' having seen success in ousting Fujimori's regime, Peru is now in a state of chaos. The government has fallen, parties are scrambling to organize for elections, and at the forefront of the nation stand the now triumphant Humala brothers who were responsible toppling the autocratic regime. While initially only an attempt at bringing down the dictator, some that had participated in the uprising have began to suggest that the time has come for a new path for Peru - one guided by its Indigenous people in the footsteps of their ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012106;With a new regime now in place the question of leadership has arisen. The obvious choices would be either Ollanta or Antauro - both of which participated in the uprising to oust Fujimori and are fiery characters with experience in the military and politics. However there are two other choices to consider that have some support within the new Nationalist Party; one being the original ideological founder of the movement, the former communist Isaac Humala - and the other being the nationalist Ulises who styles himself a more moderate nationalist and a 'pragmatist'. Whatever the choice, given the nebulous nature of the ethnocacerist movement its likely the initial leader of the state will dictate the standard for the ideology going forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012107;Despite having guided our revolution since its birth with a fiery zeal, Isaac's age has finally started to catch up to him. Recently our leader has announced his retirement from politics, having already tapped one of his three children as potential successors - with each already campaigning within the upper ranks of the party for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC8012108;With Ollanta taking over as President the time has come to decide on the fate of possible reforms. Ollanta himself wishes to see a modernization of the regime, with an opening of the command-style economy and a more pragmatic approach to foreign and domestic affairs. However, many within the party are unlikely to be pleased with radical change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012109;With Ulises now occupying the post of President the time has come to decide the fate of possible reforms. Considering himself a 'moderate' and 'pragmatist', Ulises wishes to do away with the more overt authoritarianism of the 'Incan' state and open the country up both within and without. While such sweeping reforms are likely to upset the hardliners within the party, Ulises hinges on support from the population for much of his planned agenda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8012110;With his reforms resulting in backlash not only from within the party, but from the populace as well, Ollanta is faced with almost no other choice but to resign. Already Antauro has come out against the 'neoliberal reforms', promising a return to the policies of his father - pitting himself in opposition not only to Ollanta but to Ulises as well, who promises a more 'honest reform' of the nation and a turn towards more pragmatic and democratically-based policies. Though there are a small number within the party and military that continue to support Ollanta silently, though a move to stay in power with their support would likely cause even more unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
