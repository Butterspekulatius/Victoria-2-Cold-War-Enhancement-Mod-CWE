EVT_9001023_DESC;The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) took place in Moscow, RSFSR between 29 March and 8 April 1966. It was the first Congress during Leonid Brezhnev's leadership of the Party and state. This Congress will provide places for personalities in key positions, such as Brezhnev, Kosygin and others. But it is important on because it will determine the new five-year plan of the USSR. Kosygin and his supporters, with a large majority, proposes to study the proposals of Libermann, an economist. However, there is an alternative proposed by Cybernetics, that of automating the Soviet economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001024_DESC;Not surprisingly, Liberman's reforms were chosen. This would give greater management autonomy to companies (freedom to set a price and a salary, to hire, to order...). It will be first experimented in the Shchyokinsky chemical plant at the beginning. However, this reform meets resistance from conservatives, such as Leonid Brezhnev, because it requires the party to loosen its grip on the Soviet economy and fears that this will lead to the emergence of a kind of technocracy capable of challenging their decisions, powers and privileges. Should you fully adopt Liberman's Reforms or make a compromise and adopt it partially?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001025_DESC;It was with surprise that Victor Glushkov's ideas resurfaced. Cybernetics is far from unknown and the project of automating the Soviet economy already dates back to Stalin's time. But the party seems to have realized the full potential of this project that could move the Soviet Union in the field of science and computer science ahead of the West and may well save the country in the future. The CPSU has already released money to generalize computers. It remains to be seen whether we want partial or complete automation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001027_DESC;In order to greatly improve the access and organization of our economy, it was decided a few years ago to introduce computers massively. This first step was reached and it became common for the Soviets to work with computers, no matter how big they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001033_DESC;We have just passed a new milestone, an automated calculation system has been created in order to reduce falsifications and better organize working time. This is the core of the OGAS project...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001034_DESC;We have managed to install a computer network to link our computers to better communicate information across the country and allow acceleration in the field of research. This is already a great leap forward for the West. Our economy is now much easier to manage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001070_DESC;In March 1956, rallies took place in Georgia, especially in its capital, Tbilisi. Demonstrations took place to denounce Khrushchev's speech, many of the demonstrators were Stalinists, but also nationalists, who saw Stalin as an icon of their national identity. Now, strong demands are said, such as the independence of Georgia or a radical change of the central government in Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001071_DESC;Stalin's legacy has always been a problem in the Soviet Union, especially for the ruling class, and has had many reactions and consequences in the socialist camp. Today, the question is still raised, some radicals would like to establish a real cult for Stalin, to see him above all as the one who turned the country from a backward nation into a world power or a figure of anti-fascism. Others, more moderate and conservative, would like to create a commission to judge Stalin's role for the country (Stalin made mistakes, but above all he had an important role for the country). And finally, more "reformist" people would like to denounce Stalin in all aspects and concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In order to bring us closer to China, the Secretary General can appointed a new Foreign Minister: Oleg Troyanovsky. He is a very experienced diplomat who served as ambassador to Japan. If appointed, he shall have the heavy task of trying to bring the Soviet Union and China closer together. This decision initiates a chain of events that can end the Sino-Soviet Split.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001074_DESC;Our delegation has just arrived in China to try to settle our differences. It may not be easy but not impossible. The first subject of division is political: the Soviet Union and China considered themselves, since the de-Stalinization, as the true Marxist-Leninists and accused each other of Revisionism. Do we stay on this position, do we try to compromise or do we admit our mistakes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001075_DESC;Now that the political issue has been settled, we must now be clear about our attitude towards Western Imperialism, especially the USA. Indeed, especially since the Cuban crisis, China accuses us of being too soft on the Americans. Should we maintain Khrushchev's position, engage in a discussion by putting forward a pragmatic diplomatic policy, or should we assert our hatred against Western Imperialism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001076_DESC;And finally, the last subject of discord between the USSR and China is a border problem. The region has always been a source of conflict but has become so since the Sino-Soviet breakup. Should we maintain the official line, try to calm things down with the negotiation of a treaty, or should we cede territories to China?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001077_DESC;Despite attempts at reconciliation, the meeting ended with an incomprehensible volley of personal and political insults. Our divisions have deepened and it's going to take some time before it calms down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001079_DESC;It's done! We have managed to find a compromise for everyone so that we can re-sign a Friendship Pact between our two countries. Although there are still differences between us, our two great countries are together again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001081_DESC;It's a general surprise! The American president visited Mao, in China. What little hope we had of re-establishing relations with China has been extinguished !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001082_DESC;Our leader has just made contact with the Soviet Union. The purpose of this visit is to bring us closer together, and perhaps one day to re-establish relations as before the Sino-Soviet split.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001087_DESC;After several months of negotiations and disagreements between our two countries, it seems that we have reached a balanced agreement. Now is the time to find out if we can become friends and even brothers again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001088_DESC;Thanks to the efforts of Oleg Troyanovsky, China has agreed to reconcile with us. The two leaders met in Beijing to sign a friendship pact! This is very good news for the socialist camp, not so good news for the West. The socialist camp has been strengthened by a strong ally, and the two big brothers can finally stand next to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001089_DESC;Despite Oleg Troyanovsky's efforts, China refused to reconcile with us. One thing is clear from now on, we can never be friends again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001035_DESC;On May 18, 1967, Yuri Andropov became head of the KGB. He established the principle of socialist legality, which definitively broke with Stalinist methods of arbitrariness. Very marked by his experience during the Prague Spring, he embarked on the path of reformism and began to attempt reforms to try to save the Soviet Union. He is considered, in hindsight, as the father of Perestroika and Glasnost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001036_DESC;Fyodor Kulakov, Secretary of Agriculture of the Central Committee and potential successor of Leonid Brezhnev, is a very important reformer (he is the mentor of a certain Gorbachev). The Soviet Union has always had agricultural difficulties and Kulakov is studying in a very active but secret way the experiences that are being made in Hungary and Yugoslavia. He seems to want to introduce a decentralized management of collective farms and state farms, create agricultural cooperatives based on the family contract and the farm individual. We can use this as a pretext to eliminate it politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001037_DESC;Peter Masherov, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus and a veteran of the Partisans, has, since his appointment in 1965, achieved important developments in this Republic by increasing the national income of Belarus and enabled industrial and agricultural development. However, Masherov attracted the thunderbolts of many party members as he renewed the Communist Party of Belarus and had conflictual relations with the party ideologue Mikhail Suslov and was also very close to the disgraced Kulakov. However, Leonid Brezhnev is counting on him to replace the former head of the Council of Ministers, Alexei Kossygin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001038_DESC;Dinmukhammed Kunaev, was the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and had the particularity, unlike other secretaries, of being of Kazakh nationality. He was a very close friend of Brezhnev and succeeded in developing Kazakhstan by developing the mining, raw materials and energy industries. However, a commission for the creation of an autonomous region for the German population, composed among others of Yuri Andropov, is very badly regarded by Kunaev and he is tempted to provoke riots with the Kazakh population in case this autonomy is created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001039_DESC;Shortly after the departure of Leonid Brezhnev, the Eighth General Directorate of the USSR on the orders of the 1st Vice-President of the General Committee, Semyon Tsvigun, disconnected the communication from the government, thus completely isolating the Secretary General from any information. With the help of the opposition in the KGB, Mikhail Suslov and Vladimir Scherbitsky quickly convened an emergency plenary session of the Central Committee, in which Yuri Andropov was accused of "using the power of the KBG to prepare a Coup, of being a spy at the service of the West" and so on. Yuri Andropov tried to retaliate, but after Vladimir Scherbitsky's speech, accusing him of planning to assassinate Brezhnev, he realized that he had lost. The Committee adopts the decision to remove Andropov from all posts, banish him from the Party and arrest him. The new President of the KGB begins a massive purge of Andropov's staff and to replace them with more suitable employees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001040_DESC;For the last two years, Brezhnev has been nothing but a figurehead. His health deteriorated during the winter of 1981. During this time, the country was ruled by Vladimir Scherbitsky and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine took decisions himself, so much so that Kiev had become the new capital of the USSR. The question of Leonid Brezhnev's succession was no longer a problem now that the reformist threat had been eliminated at the root. Rumors say that the Secretary General has already told me in confidence that he can now die in peace. His death heralds the end of one era and the beginning of another for the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001041_DESC;In the struggle to improve the economic situation of the state, Andropov began with a large-scale campaign to strengthen labor discipline. At the same time, high-profile corruption cases were triggered and a fight against unearned income and speculation was declared. The fight against commercial abuses became widespread. During the years of Andropov's reign, the number of persons convicted of criminal offenses increased significantly. Andropov began a "purge" of the party and the state apparatus, including the security organs. At the beginning of 1983, Andropov instructed Gorbachev and Ryzhkov to start preparing an economic reform, the word of Perestroika began to be used and was later taken over by Gorbachev. One does not know, however, the exact content of this reform even though she knows that it was much less radical than what was done afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001043_DESC;The greatest scourge of the Soviet Union is certainly its corruption. In order to curb it, Shcherbitsky carried out anti-corruption investigations, but not against the people, but against important members of the Politburo and other political bodies of great importance. Rarely, some of these trials even received media coverage. A major purge seems to have begun, but the targets are party cadres this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001044_DESC;Shcherbitsky's Purge now attacks the administration of the state. The population and even the whole world seems to finally realize that something is changing in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the conditions for entering the bureaucracy have been broadened in order to hire people on their skills. Of course, the party makes sure that all these people remain loyal to the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001045_DESC;In order to ensure the loyalty of the party and to fill the vacant positions, the General Secretary has appointed a new Second Secretary. He will make sure that the new politburo members are young and, above all, loyal to the new leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001046_DESC;Shcherbitsky's Purge seems to be over and a strict protocol was put in place to check the loyalty, competence and non-corruption of its members and can affect anyone. Even General Secretary Shcherbitsky was affected by his investigations and published the results in Pravda. Yet, although the main figure of reformism in the USSR has been eliminated, Gorbachev stands out and manages to gather a small faction within the party. He poses no threat to the future of the country because Gorbachev has neither the position nor the skills to conduct an effective opposition policy. It remains to be seen whether one wishes to eliminate all opposition or simply leave it in its corner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001048_DESC;The economy of the Soviet Union has been stagnant for several years and economic reforms are needed. With his administrative talents, Vladimir Shcherbitsky began to undertake economic reforms that focused on the well-being of the population and better organization of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001049_DESC;In order to better organize the Soviet economy, a proposal is increasingly making its way within the Politburo: the partial automation of the economy. Although this does not please one part of the party, it would facilitate and simplify the organization of workers by improving the quality of goods. But only the Secretary General can decide to adopt this proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001050_DESC;To conclude the economic reforms and still with a view to reform the economy of the USSR, Vladimir Scherbitsky organized a special meeting with the various leaders of the Eastern bloc to strengthen economic ties between the communist countries. This should lead to an economic boom in the whole region and greatly help the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001064_DESC;While small political reforms are underway, debates are taking place within the party as to whether more power should be given to the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest legislative institution. Some members of the party would like, under Leninism, to see the Supreme Soviet become a true legislative body, in which laws would be discussed by the party in this assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001065_DESC;A new question arises with regard to the place of the media. Should we always keep a control on the media by influencing them, in order to avoid the spread of any anti-Soviet propaganda, or do we give them frankly more freedom to let the people express themselves as they wish ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001066_DESC;The trade unions under the Soviet Union, led by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, had a complex relationship with industry, the Communist Party and the government, since the Soviet Union was ideologically supposed to be a state in which working class members ran the country and themselves. It is the turn of the Syndicate to undergo a new debate in the party, should we give more power to opposition syndicates in the name of individual and collective liberties or do we always keep some control over them by influencing them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001067_DESC;The question of nationalities within the Soviet Union has always been a thorny issue. The problem is still present and is even growing and could lead to problems. Should we just repress its movements and monitor them closely or should we stop this policy of Russification of peoples and recognize the true equality of peoples?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001068_DESC;A new congress begins today, but not an ordinary one, because it is broadcast live on Soviet television and shows a new face of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the various reforms of our leader, the USSR has been able to evolve while remaining faithful to the principles of the Communist Party. The Soviet Union seems to stand, more stable than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001069_DESC;Comrade Vladimir Shcherbitsky, General Secretary of the CPSU died, leaving behind him a Soviet Union stronger internationally, was able to reorganize the country's economy while getting rid of corruption. Whatever happens, the whole country mourns a great man and even countries, such as China or other communist parties, which had stopped being loyal to the USSR, came to bid him a final farewell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001090_DESC;Comrade Viktor Grishin, leader of the Soviet Union, has died. He was throughout his life a convinced Brezhnevist and continued to apply his policy when he took power after the death of Chermenko. The country is no longer as stable as when he took power, and the economic power of the country has become even weaker. The rise to power of the Reformists became inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001092_DESC;The election of Grigory Romanov as Secretary General was made possible by the support of Andrei Gromyko. Without this, the reformist Mikhail Gorbachev could have obtained the post by taking advantage of the confusion of Chermenko's death. This is proof that Gorbachev's supporters only want power and not the success of the communist cause, so it is essential to get rid of them as soon as possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001094_DESC;In order to ensure that he would never again be subjected to this attempted takeover by the reformists, Grigori set up a system of ideological examination within the party to make sure that every member was a convinced communist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001095_DESC;Well aware that the bureaucracy has taken too great a place in the country and that it no longer relies on their achievements. The General Secretary Grigory Romanov begins to put more discipline, people are chosen for skills and employment in the party and in the administration is no longer guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001096_DESC;The question of nationalism has always been a problem for the USSR. In recent years, nationalism seems to be starting to gain strength again. Faced with this problem, we can either stifle them again or ensure the equality of peoples through political reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001097_DESC;Soviet Jews, deemed "cosmopolitan," were considered a security risk or potential traitors. Some were arrested, or punished in other ways, for daring to express a desire to leave the country for the West, which was seen as a confirmation of suspicions about their lack of loyalty. However, with the assumption of power by Grigori Romanov, who was a notorious anti-Semite, discriminatory and stigmatizing practices for this people could reappear. It remains to be seen whether the Secretary General will put his opinions aside or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001098_DESC;Grigory Romanov was certainly in favor of reforming the Soviet economy, but had a different vision from other party members. Indeed, in addition to wanting to improve the management of the party, he wanted to set up an automation of the country. The problem was the courage to find enough support in the party, the administration and the army to ensure such an undertaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001106_DESC;In the same way as in Leningrad, Grigory Romanov started to build scientific complexes all over the country in order to help the economic development of the country but also to help in research and try to catch up with the accumulated technological backlog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001107_DESC;Paradoxically enough, while many people see the new Secretary General as a tough person, some concessions of censorship in the creative sector are made. This resulted in the creation of new music clubs and filmmakers became freer to experiment with new genres.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001099_DESC;It is time to examine the situation with COMECON. To ensure the loyalty of its countries to the Soviet Union and its interests, a meeting will soon be held to decide which way to go: Should we use the COMECON to the advantage of the USSR by forming an economic union, which would make the Eastern countries dependent on us, or should we take the example of the European model, with the creation of a central bank and everything that can go with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001102_DESC;Today, Grigory Romanov is dead. Despite the discontent of some people in the party, he managed, thanks to the automation of the economy, to reform and modernize the Soviet Union without its collapse. He did not stop protecting the interests of the Soviet Union, and increase its economic power and the welfare of the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001103_DESC;Today, Grigory Romanov is dead. However, despite his good management, both internally and externally, the economic and political situation of the country has improved but has not solved the problems. His death announces the return to power of reformists who want to make reforms as Andropov or Gorbachev had done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001104_DESC;Andrei Gromyko never really liked doctors. Already in 1986, after a serious flu illness and a developed intoxication, Gromyko suffered a clinical cardiac arrest and managed to be brought back to life in extremis. However, the pain that the General Secretary has seems more serious and he might not survive if nothing is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001105_DESC;July 1989, Gromyko, not wanting to disturb his sleeping relatives, endured a sharp pain in the chest until the morning and by the time they realized it, it was already too late for the doctor and the General Secretary died suddenly while still reforming the Soviet Union. After a farewell ceremony was held to pay tribute to him as a respected Secretary General and diplomat, a new meeting to choose a new leader was held. Two candidates claimed the position: Mikhail Gorbachev, a reformist and several times pretender to the post, and Egor Ligachev, a former ally of Gorbachev, but with Gromyko in power, he was able to show notable differences between them, especially on the economic level, making him a moderate reformist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001108_DESC;With the aim of modernizing the Soviet Union by introducing liberalism. Andrei Gromyko presents a new economic form called "Planned Economy with Market Elements". Contrary to what one might think, this is not a policy like in China with Deng Xiaoping, but a new practice that consists of keeping the Soviet economic system (planned economy) but the government will now allow the population to own their small business, still controlled by the state, and even to be able to direct a small profit. The goal is to give more economic freedom to the population and to the government to find money easily while trying to scuttle the black market that reigns in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001109_DESC;Several months after the launch of this concept, we can see that Gromyko's goal is being accomplished. Small and medium-sized enterprises began to flourish all over the Soviet Union. Certainly, a minority within the party and the population demanded more freedom, but for the vast majority of the population, the fact that they could own a small business and make a living from it while having the comforts offered by the Soviet government made the measure very popular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001110_DESC;Today, the government announced new economic reforms to make the Soviet regime more flexible. Its first announcement is on price policy. Indeed, as the Soviet Union is a planned economy and the vast majority of needs are provided by the state, the currency was not really "conventional" money and was not even used for exchange even within the country. Should we set up a currency that is always under our control but that can fluctuate according to the demand or should we go further by starting to control only the first necessities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001111_DESC;It is time to decide on the policy we have with the workers. Should we formalize Andropov's policy by disciplining workers by ensuring the quality of their work that they are all sufficiently competent and useful for the country in the position they occupy or should we go further by declaring that the workers are free, which would involve introducing notions that were unknown to the Soviet people such as the labor contract and etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001112_DESC;And finally, trade policy. It is above all a question of knowing how much we want to open ourselves to the world: a selective protectionism, although we are open, the importation of foreign product, especially those of the capitalists, will be overtaxed or a limited protectionism where our openness to the world is. larger and more flexible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001113_DESC;A news has just been announced with surprise. In coordination with the USSR and all the countries of Eastern Europe, it was decided to open the borders with the communist countries and to set up an immigration quota for the outside. Looks like the Iron Curtain is starting to open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001114_DESC;In order to facilitate economic exchanges between communist countries, some people have hypothesized the creation of a central bank to better control our monetary policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001115_DESC;With the reform of COMECON into an economic organization standardizing the economy of all the countries of Eastern Europe with the USSR, we will henceforth be able to trade among ourselves and ensure certain forms of economic stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001116_DESC;After the successful implementation of economic reforms by the Gromyko government, it is high time to tackle political reforms in order to liberalize the Soviet Union and to give it a more human face on the international level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001117_DESC;The first reform that is on the table is the reform of the legislative policy. Although there is a parliament (Supreme Soviet), it is in fact controlled by the Communist Party, and they make the laws in the whole country. Does the Party still have this privilege or is the legislative power returned to the Supreme Soviet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001118_DESC;This issue is likely to be a little more thorny, that of elections. Theoretically, elections existed in the USSR, but it was only a façade. This time it is a question of how far we want to go with these elections: Does the Party let the people choose their candidates or do we hold contested elections within the Party?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001119_DESC;A new thorny issue will take place, it is the issue of freedom of the press. Even if the Secretary General wants to grant more freedom, he has not necessarily indicated how far he wants to go. Some members want to continue to control the media while others want to grant more freedom but make sure that no anti-revolutionary propaganda is published.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001120_DESC;The influence of the army in the Soviet economy has always been very large, and conscription plays an important role in it, since every man of age to enlist in the army for at least 2 years.

However, some proposed to stop the military service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001121_DESC;The trade unions under the Soviet Union, led by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, had a complex relationship with industry, the Communist Party and the government, since the Soviet Union was ideologically supposed to be a state in which working class members ran the country and themselves. However, still in this desire to liberalize the country, the question is how far we want to go with the reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001122_DESC;The Soviet Union has many ethnicities which has always been a problem for the country and has always applied, as under the Russian Empire, a Russian-speaking policy to try to assimilate all its people. In recent years, however, more and more inter-ethnic conflicts, should we stop this Russian-speaking policy and really apply an equality between the peoples or do we change nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Indeed, the Supreme Soviet has just adopted a new constitution, called $YEAR$ Constitution, and it grants a little more political, economic and societal freedom but still reminds the central role of the Communist Party in its institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001124_DESC;Comrade Andrei Gromyko, General Secretary of the CPSU, has just died of a heart attack. His death was considered inevitable for a long time but he managed to live long enough to modernize the Soviet Union without adopting radical reforms. The country still seems to be stable and still holds a prominent place as a superpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001125_DESC;After long debate within the Party to determine the liberalization of the country's economy, the proposal of Gorbachev (Perestroika) was not retained, deemed too radical, in profile of that of Ligachev. From now on, the government announces the return of the NEP. The state will allow the population to create small or large enterprises in specific areas and will also encourage self-management of enterprises. This policy is criticized by some conservatives and the General Secretary recalled that even Lenin had temporarily given in to capitalism in order to revitalize the Soviet economy. It remains to be seen whether this policy will be effective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001126_DESC;Many companies have been opened very quickly throughout the country, the benefits to the state has also increased ...

EVT_9001128_DESC;Surprisingly enough, General Secretary Egor Ligachev announced his resignation on television, explaining that his departure is above all a political rather than a forced retirement. The situation of the Soviet Union is not brilliant, the attempt to return to the NEP, with the establishment of cooperatives and a strong decentralization has caused the emergence of an oligarchy and the decline in the production of consumer goods. His attempt to open up the political scene allowed people like Boris Yeltsin to enter the legal opposition, which further weakened the unity of the Party.
